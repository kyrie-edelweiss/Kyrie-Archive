# Chapter Seven - Red Sex
**KATHERINA SERIES – PRIVATE SEGMENT**  
**YEAR OF RECORD:** Mid-to-Late 1985  
**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Unknown  

---

The sex was a little awkward.  

She always felt so *small*.

She kept trembling, like she wasn’t built for touch. Like something had broken and regrown inside her crooked.

Katherina sang sometimes, low and off-key. And she danced. Not like a girl, but like a marionette. Tangled strings, twirling just out of reach, her toes skimming ash.

That skinny, skinny frame…

That tired, tired act…

She's uninteresting wearing all that black.

She wore it like she owed it to someone—maybe to the dead, maybe to Venus herself.

I shouldn't, but I peer into her dreams.

She dreams of before the flash. Of a time when Venus and the **SUN** were close—*intimate*. She says they used to kiss through clouds, through fire. She says Venus was radiant once. That she *glowed*.

And she wonders:

> “If they were so close… why did he leave?”  
> “Was it all the noise, the screaming, the endless bickering?”  
> “Was it the sky, stained and bleeding from all the smog?”  
> “Was it the poison-laced oceans and the endless factories?”  
> “Or was it the tears she shed constantly?”  
> “Did her sorrow deform her?”  
> “Would the **SUN** still make love to her disfigured mantle?”  
> “Did VENUS feel lonely, too?”

 And then she spirals from there…

> “Why is **MARS** always up there?”  
> “Why is he so distant?”  
> “Why won’t he come closer?”  
> “Why is he always red with silence?”  
> “If I kissed him, would I start burning, too?”  
> “I’m his little **SUN**. I’m his little **SUN**…”

That's usually when I shut her up.

I don’t want her to see how close I am to burning, too.

# Chapter Eight - Waiting For Black Metal Records To Come In The Mail
**KATHERINA SERIES – DISSOCIATIVE PHASE**  
**DATE OF RECORD:** Early 1986  
**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Unknown  

---

Katherina's life had become a joke at her own expense.

Every morning, **MARS** was turned just a little further away.

Not physically—she could still see him, red and glowering through the acid-streaked clouds—but metaphysically, he felt distant. Like he had retracted something. Like his soul had taken one slow, deliberate step back.

Craters like beauty marks. Mountain ranges like deep scars.

The tin box of mixed teabags was nearly empty. That was her one ritual, her one remaining comfort. The flavors bled together, cheap things imported from **JUPITER**'s moons, stale and scentless. Still, she’d let the bag sit in boiled water for exactly five minutes. Five minutes of control. Five minutes of pretending she had a body that wasn’t falling apart.

She subsisted on sugar cubes and rice. Sometimes honey if she rationed right. The sweetness barely registered. She suspected **MARS** liked her thin. Her hip bones stuck out like warning signs. Her wrists could cut.

All the standard phosphorus lights malfunctioned. Gasoline was low to the point where she moved in pitch black, counting steps.

Keeping herself busy with arts and crafts was growing more and more difficult. Drawing had become shameful. **MARS** didn’t like the way she depicted him-said it was "dishonest." Her karaoke was increasingly uninspired. And the monospeaker—*that* speaker—emitted this faint whine, a mosquito in her ear that never died. It broadcast his voice sometimes, or a distorted imitation of it.

He still enjoyed her dancing. Actually, he loved it. Sensual, slow. She danced even when her legs shook. Even when her lungs burned.

She wasn’t sure when the talking stopped.

They used to talk about strange, beautiful things. Cosmic things. Ideas. Symbols. She’d ask questions, and **MARS** would answer in riddles that felt profound.

The demands came faster. Her mind couldn’t keep up. Sometimes she'd forget her own name.

> *Sex ruins everything that could’ve been beautiful.*

She didn’t remember where she heard that. Or if she said it first. Maybe it was in a dream. Maybe it was a thought Venus once whispered before the **SUN** left her behind.

The worst part was the suspicion. **MARS** had to be hiding something. Behind all the cold lust, behind the obsession—something was *wrong*. She didn’t have the words. She only had a sensation deep in her stomach.

This could not be kept up any longer.

# Chapter Ten - Black Metal Records
**KATHERINA SERIES – TERMINAL PSYCHOGENIC EVENT**  
**YEAR OF RECORD:** Late 1987  
**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Unknown 
**CLASSIFICATION:** BLACK CODE - UNAUTHORIZED MATERIAL

Tonight was silent.  

He wasn’t speaking tonight.  
Not aloud. Not through the crackling wires, not through the walls or the machines.  
**MARS** didn’t need to anymore.  

He preferred the inside of her skull.

His voice burrowed, uninvited, into her thoughts. Sometimes as words. Sometimes just a pressure behind the eyes.
Some nights, he would press into her muscles, inhabit them, wear her bones like clothes.

Walked her across the room.  
Made her smile.  
Made her beg.  
Made her touch herself.

But tonight?  
Stillness.  

Katherina had learned not to *think*.  

Thinking was dangerous.  
A single wrong phrase, a flicker of doubt—  
and he could be inside her again.  

So she went through the motions.  

As she feigned the usual bedtime routine - brisk dip in the lake, drying off her body and touching up her hair, rubbing some of the local vegetation on her teeth…

She slipped up.  

She had it. She had the thought.

And like a hand to the throat—  
He was there.  

No warning. No chance.  

Her skull *split open* with his voice.  

> **SINNER, WRONG DOER, EVIL DOER, WORKER OF INIQUITY, A BAD EXAMPLE, SCOUNDREL, VILLAIN, KNAVE, VIPER, WRETCH, THE DEVIL INCARNATE, MONSTER, DEMON, FALLEN ANGEL, LOST SHEEP, BLACK SHEEP, A LOAFER AND A SNEAK. A GOOD FOR NOTHING FUCKING BITCH AND A WHORE.**

It wasn’t just noise.  
It was *penetration*.  

He entered her thoughts like a blade.  
Slid into the gaps of her memories.  
Flooded every synapse with his filth.  
Took her body from her, again.  

She felt weak. She felt her legs move without consent. She felt sick to her stomach.
Her mouth twitch. Her spine arch.

_"leave me alone. you have my body already, let the rest of me be"_

But he was inside already.  
And she couldn’t scream without him tasting it.

*“leave me alone. leave me alone. please don't do it again, please, i can't do it anymore.”*

Her voice sounded so far away.

_“leave m_**E ALONE.”**

**“LEAVE ME ALONE.”**

**“MY SOUL IS FLAWLESS AND PURE.”**

**“I DISREGARD THE PRECAUTIONS.”**

**“I WANT TO BREAK.”**

And that’s when something would break.
Not inside her.  
*But in the sky.*

**KATHERINA**'s hand rose—unthinking. Instinctual.  
Like Venus herself moved through her veins.  

She struck upward.  

Tore at the heavens with thought turned to weapon.

The sky peeled.  
The stars *shivered*.
Her thoughts ran down, dripped down, became reality.
The curse of the **RED KING**.

And Mars came undone.  

**KATHERINA** pulled him down.  
Ripped him from the black.  
Held him—smaller than ever—in her hand.  

And then—  
**the flash.**

Blinding.
Yellow.
Revealed.

And there it was — what Mars hid all this time. The truth she was *raped* away from knowing.

> The **SUN**.  
> Still shining. Still burning.  
> Hidden behind Mars.  

He had hidden the dawn.  

He stole the light,  
stole the warmth,  
stole *the life itself*—  

—from **KATHERINA**.  
—from *Venus*.  
—from *everyone*.  

Mars had done it.

He had silenced the world in shadow and called it "love."

> Mars wasn’t love.  
> He was *control*.  
> He was the night.  
> He was the nightmare.  
> The thing that whispers _“you’ll never be free.”_ 

But **KATHERINA** had ripped him out.  

Mars was responsible.

Mars would be sorry.

Mars was the night, the nightmare.

**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Atmospheric Apex  
**CLASSIFICATION:** BLACK CODE - UNAUTHORIZED MATERIAL

_(Above the churning yellow clouds of Venus, **KATHERINA** levitates. In her cupped palms, she holds Mars—small, dim, stripped of dominion. Her jaw is clenched. Her eyes burn. She's fuming with anger, boiling, stewing… frothing. And yet her mouth won't open.)_

*Mars* (begging):  
Don't do this.  
Put me back, please.  
I thought you loved me.

_**KATHERINA**_ (voice booming across the night sky):  
**I THOUGHT I LOVED YOU. BUT YOU WERE JUST ALL I HAD. YOU MADE SURE YOU WERE ALL I HAD.**

*Mars* (softly):  
That’s not true, **KATHERINA**.  
You were all *I* had too.  
Celestial bodies were never meant to touch the human world.  
But I broke the rules. For you.  
I just wanted to feel.  
To know what it was like.

_**KATHERINA**_ (seething):  
**SEE WHAT? TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO USE SOMEONE LIKE A FLESH SOCK?**

*Mars*:  
It wasn’t supposed to go like that.  
You taught me what pleasure meant.  
I didn’t know what it was to *want* before you.  
And then… I couldn’t stop.  
I was cursed with hunger.  
And you—  
You were so warm.  
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, **KATHERINA**.

_(Silence. She doesn’t answer. He shifts in her palms.)_

*Mars*:  
We can fix this.  
We’ve both changed.  
Let’s start again.  
This time… you say my name first.

_**KATHERINA**_:  
**"NO. I REFUSE. I CAN'T LET YOU TAKE CONTROL AGAIN."**

*Mars* (gently):  
Oh, dear. Control?  
You’ve grown so much.  
There's no point in controlling you anymore.  
And I’ve always watched you from afar.  
Even when you thought you were alone.  
I know you - I always kept an eye out for you.
Because you were special…  

_(Her face flickers—contempt, grief, longing. She begins to tremble.)_

*Mars* (whispering):  
Aren’t you…  
my little **SUN**?

_(Her scream splits the upper atmosphere. Then, beneath the scream—sobs. Raw. Childlike. Her hands loosen.)_

*Mars* (soothing):  
Shh… calm, calm now.  
You want to know, don’t you?  
The truth. About your parents. Your origin.  
Who you really are?

_(She hesitates. Then a quiet answer.)_

_**KATHERINA**_:  
**"I… I DO. I DO WANT TO KNOW."**

*Mars*:  
You were born of two Venusian mothers.  
You lived in a cozy little commune under the earth, away from any exterior inferrence.  
They loved you more than anything in this world.  
They would’ve kept you, protected you, worshipped you.  

But the Seven Planet Authority—the human government of the system— found you.  
They ripped you from their arms.  
Raised you on the surface, in bunkers.  
Malnourished you. Hurt you.  
Called you names—  
_Bad omen. Chimera. Icon of the coming revolution._

When you came of age, they injected you.  
White, liquid forgetfulness.  
You forgot everything.  
And when they were done with you—  
They threw you out.  
They shot everyone else.  
Left you to wander.

That’s your story, **KATHERINA**.  
Isn’t that what you wanted?

_(She convulses. Rage and disbelief churn in her gut. She grips Mars tighter.)_

_**KATHERINA**_:  
**"THAT CAN'T BE… IT'S LIES… YOU'RE LYING AGAIN…"**

*Mars* (gasping):  
Stop—please—you’re hurting me!

_(Reflex. Her grip loosens.)_

*Mars*:  
I was trying to protect you…  
From the bitter truth and all the pain that comes with it.  
I love you, **KATHERINA**.  
We can begin again.  
Do you trust me?

_(A pause. Her mind sways like a candle in vacuum.)_

_**KATHERINA**_ (quiet):  
**"I TRUST YOU."**

*Mars*:  
Say my name.

_**KATHERINA**_:_  
**"MARS… I—"**

_(The moment the name passes her lips, the spell snaps.)_

_Katherina:_  
—NO—

_(But it’s too late. She drops. Her body plummets, limp, through the sulfurous skies. Falling—not in love, but back to earth. Into ruin.)_

_**MARS**_ (ascending, regaining form):  
**I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.**

_(He catches her gently. Her skin pales. Her hair drains of color. Her eyes go hollow. Her essence returns to Venus—the place of her making, and of her unmaking.)_

_**MARS**_ (stroking her hair):  
**MY LITTLE SUN.** 
**I NEVER MEANT FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.** 
**I JUST…**
**I CAN'T BELIEVE I ALLLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN.**

_(He lowers her down—into the dirt.)_

_**MARS**_ (whispering):  
**"VENUS IS DEAD."**  
**"I NAME YOU VENUS."**  
**"LONG LIVE VENUS."**

_(And **VENUS** would be once more.)_
