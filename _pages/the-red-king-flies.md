## Period: Present Day … Year: 1989 … Location: NEPTUNE

Chief Executive Officer Edelweiss sits – hands in lap – in front of her reckorder device. This was the same meeting table she delivered hundreds of rousing speeches in. Only now, she's alone.

"Good morning, citizens. This is Avery-Mary Edelweiss."

*The digital backdrop behind her frame depicts seven planets in a ring around her – one of them hangs above the rest.*

*There is a shaking uncertainty in her voice.*

"Our yearly investment plan has s-shifted drastically… We're diverting all of our… r-resources across the **MERCURY** neo-industries… the **JUPITER** research station and all of its remaining moons… the **URANUS** defense barracks… **NEPTUNE**'s metropolis and management quarters… and lastly the **SUN** discipline center into… into…"

*The two women – a brunette & a red-hair – holding her at gunpoint push their barrels into her face slightly.*

"Into the dissolution of the Seven Planet Federation."

*The guards nod approvingly. Then, a piece of paper is swiped across the table.*

"As I sign this piece of paper… I hereby declare… the wholesale acquisition of the S-seven Planet Federation… to the new Venusian administration…"

*They stare at her handwriting attentively for any slip-ups, any legal loopholes she could toss in there. None would come.*

"I… I shall… No, I can't do this."

*The two women and their snake eyes throw a death glare.*

"I can't do this. Please let me go, I have a husb—

*Blood splatters the lens of the reckoner. The sound was deafening. Her still body kneels uselessly next to the table. The red liquid pools under the hole in her skull. It was the redhead who took the shot.*

"Remember."

*The brunette announces, wiping the lens of the reckoner whilst tossing her standard issue submachine gun on the table, as the redhead takes off her Venusian jacket and stows her rifle against the wall.*

"Remember the dignity of your womanhood. Do not appeal, do not beg, do not grovel. Take courage, join hands, stand besides us, fight with us."

*The speaker adjusts her hair. In the background, the redhead attaches a tape to the reckoner.*

"This song will broadcast until every last reactionary is found and shot."

## Period: Present Day … Year: 1989 … Location: NEPTUNE

**[CAMERA FEED: LIVE RECKONER BROADCAST]**  
**[Status: Hijacked Signal – Origin Unverified]**

The image flickers. Then stabilizes.

**Avery-Mary Edelweiss** sits alone at the long obsidian table where, for over a decade, she delivered her iron briefings—cold, clear, invulnerable. Now, her posture is brittle. Her hands rest tightly folded in her lap. Her breathing is shallow.

Behind her, a luminous digital sigil rotates silently: seven planets arranged in a ring. One of them—**VENUS**—now glows brighter than the others. It pulses. It watches.

The feed stabilizes further.

> **EDELWEISS:**  
> “Good morning, citizens. This is Avery-Mary Edelweiss.”

Her voice, once resolute, now stutters. Fear is new on her tongue.

> “Our… our yearly investment plan has… shifted. We’re diverting—no—**we’ve diverted** all core resources from **Mercury’s neo-industrial corridors**, the **Jupiter orbital annex**, the **Uranian Pillar defense network**, and this very station on **Neptune**. We’ve redirected funding, and all jurisdictional assets from the Solar Detention Center… to…”

She swallows hard. Her eyes flick briefly offscreen.

Two women stand behind her.

One is **brunette**, her Federation combat gear half-stripped, re-patched with crude Venusian insignia—a hybrid of protest and birthmark. The other is **red-haired**—calm, expressionless, unmistakable in her silence.

Both women hold matte-black sidearms against Edelweiss’s skull.

> “Into the… dissolution of the Seven Planet Federation.”

The brunette gives a firm nod.

The redhead does not blink.

A sheet of paper is placed before Edelweiss. Legal script. Binding code. Old law from before the privatization of the solar judiciary—still respected in internal control.

Edelweiss stares at it. Her hand hovers. Trembles. Then writes.

> “As I sign this declaration… I hereby transfer all material, political, and enforcement authority… from the Seven Planet Federation… to the new **Venusian administration**...”

She hesitates. The pen stills. Her eyes flash wide for a moment.

> “I… I can’t do this.”

The two women stare.

The redhead’s mouth remains closed. But her weapon rises half an inch.

> “Please—please, I have a husb—”

The gunshot is loud.

A ripple of crimson spatters across the reckoner’s lens. Edelweiss’s body folds to the ground, crumpling like a plastic doll, her cheek thudding softly against the tile. Blood pools beneath her skull.

For the first time, the redhead speaks.

> “Remember.”

The brunette—calm, practiced—leans into the camera, wiping the lens clean with her sleeve. She sets her submachine gun on the table with gentle finality. The feed sharpens again.

> “**Remember the dignity of your womanhood.**  
> Do not appeal.  
> Do not beg.  
> Do not grovel.  
> Take courage.  
> Join hands.  
> Stand beside us.  
> **Fight with us.**”

Behind her, the redhead removes her jacket. The inside lining is red with Venusian script. She reaches into her rucksack. Pulls a magnetic tape. Black casing. No label.

> She inserts it into the reckoner.

The redhead turns back to the screen. Only her eyes are visible now, framed by her flame-colored hair.

> “This message will repeat until the last reactionary is found and shot.  
> To the remaining Federation sympathizers:
> Your outposts are obsolete.
> Your wars are irrelevant.
> Your tongues are severed.
> Your contracts burned.”

Let me know if you’d like this chapter followed up with a Venusian **declaration broadcast**, or a post-coup scene showing the ruins of the 7-P Committee headquarters as **ritualists** begin to rebuild it in **Venusian image**.
