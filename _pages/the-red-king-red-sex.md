# Period: Present Day … Year: 1985 … Location: Venus

The sex was a little awkward.

She always felt so small.

Katherina loved to sing and dance. She'd take a step back every now and then, just to keep me off her track – keeping me lulled, entranced…

That skinny, skinny frame…

That tired, tired act…

She's uninteresting wearing all that black.

I just can't help myself – I take peeks into her dreams, every now and then. She thinks of the times before the flash – of Venus and the **SUN**, that they were so close she'd kiss him. She wonders "if they were so close, why'd the **SUN** leave?".

And then she spirals from there…

"Was it the way everyone screamed and bickered here?"

"The smog covering our sky?"

"The factories and the residential districts?"

"Or was it all the tears Venus shed?"

"The labyrinthine tunnels in her skin?"

"Would the **SUN** still make love to her disfigured mantle?"

"Did Venus feel lonely, too?"

"Why is **MARS** always standing up there? Why can't he come closer, why can't he embrace me, why must he be so distant? If we kissed, would I start burning too? I'm his little **SUN**, I'm his little **SUN**…"

I normally shut her up by the time she gets to that part.
