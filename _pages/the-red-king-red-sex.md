The sex was a little awkward.  

She always felt so *small*.

Not physically—her body was long and wiry, almost stretched thin by gravity that never loved her back. No, she was small in the way people get when they forget how to be real. When they perform every gesture like it's been passed down from ghosts.

She kept trembling, like she wasn’t built for touch. Like something had broken and regrown inside her crooked.

Katherina sang sometimes, low and off-key. And she danced. Not like a girl, but like a marionette. Tangled strings, twirling just out of reach, her toes skimming ash.

That skinny, skinny frame…

That tired, tired act…

She's uninteresting wearing all that black.

She wore it like she owed it to someone—maybe to the dead, maybe to Venus herself.

I shouldn't, but I peer into her dreams.

She dreams of before the flash. Of a time when Venus and the **SUN** were close—*intimate*. She says they used to kiss through clouds, through fire. She says Venus was radiant once. That she *glowed*. Like I remember Venus.

And she wonders:

> “If they were so close… why did he leave?”  
> “Was it all the noise, the screaming, the endless bickering?”  
> “Was it the sky, stained and bleeding from all the smog?”  
> “Was it the poison-laced oceans and the endless factories?”  
> “Or was it the tears she shed constantly?”  
> “Did her sorrow deform her?”  
> “Would the **SUN** still make love to her disfigured mantle”
> “Did VENUS feel lonely, too?”

 And then she spirals from there…

> “Why is **MARS** always up there?”  
> “Why is he so distant?”  
> “Why won’t he come closer?”  
> “Why is he always red with silence?”  
> “If I kissed him, would I start burning, too?”  
> “I’m his little **SUN**. I’m his little **SUN**…”

That's usually when I shut her up.

I don’t want her to see how close I am to burning, too.
