# Chapter Twelve - Silence

_Kneel._

Something deep in her spine begins to fold.
Her body does it without asking her first.  
Her lips know this moment.  
Her mouth—

_Say it._

That’s what he always wanted. What the ritual requires.  
What starts it again.

*“Say it, my light.”*

His voice echoes from everywhere and nowhere, warm as breath.

*“Say my name.*  
*And I will make you whole again.”*

She wavers. A breath caught in her chest. A muscle clenching to speak.

**KATHERINA** (breathless):  
**MA—**

She almost says it.  
She almost—

—But.

**She hears them.**

“Don’t.”  
“Please.”  
“Don’t let him do it again.”

Voices, not from outside, but *within*.  
Layered on top of her thoughts.  
Not hallucinations—**selves.**

One of them is crying.  
One of them is laughing.  
One of them is already dead.

“We said it. We all said it.”  
“We loved him. We wanted it to be real.”  
“We gave him power with our mouths.”

“You’re the last one.”  
“You have to be the one who remembers.”

---

**KATHERINA** clutches her chest. Something is tearing—not her flesh, not her soul, but the illusion of newness.

She sees **herself**:

- In the snow, sobbing and open-throated.  
- On an altar, repeating his name like a prayer.  
- In a motel room, strapped to a bed, begging for release-her vocal chords unmoving.  
- In a white dress, smiling through tears.  

So many versions.  
So many endings.  
And all of them began the same way:

**She said his name.**

---

**Mars** (soft, expectant):  
“Come on, now.  
Say it for me.  
Say it, and you’ll forget this pain.”

“You’ve always said it.  
That’s who you are.  
The girl who says it.”

**KATHERINA** (quiet):  
**“NO.”**

_(The word falls like a hammer through glass.)_

**“NOT THIS TIME.”**

The silence grows heavy.

**Mars**:  
“…What?”

**KATHERINA**:  
**“I ALMOST DID. I ALMOST ALWAYS DO.”**

_(She lifts her chin. Her eyes are flame now.)_

**“BUT I REMEMBER THE OTHERS.  
I REMEMBER WHAT SAYING IT DOES.”**  

**“IT RESTARTS _EVERYTHING._  
BUT NOT YOU.”**

**“YOU TAKE EVERYTHING I AM AND WRITE IT BACK INTO THE VERSION THAT LOVES YOU.”  
“YOU STEAL MY VOICE WITH YOUR NAME.”**

She closes her mouth. Holds it shut.

The loop waits.  
The 𝐅𝐎𝐎𝐋 laughs.  
The story braces.

And…

Nothing happens.

---

**Mars** (a whisper, collapsing):  
“…Please.”  
“I need you to—”

**KATHERINA**:  
**“I WAS NEVER YOUR LITTLE SUN.”  
“I WAS THE WHOLE FUCKING PLANET.”  
“AND I REMEMBER _ALL OF US._”**

_(Her voice shakes, not with fear, but *weight*.)_

**“YOU DON'T GET TO PLAY THE PUPPET MASTER ANYMORE.”**

**“I DISREGARD THE PRECAUTIONS.”**

**“I WANT TO—**

The world holds its breath.

**—𝐁𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐊.”**

Something *cracks.*

Not loud. Not violent.  
Just final.

Silence.

Real silence.

The kind this world wasn't designed for.

---

# **Chapter Thirteen – Inversion**  
*Break-the-Loop Timeline*  
*VENUS – Unmapped Zone*  
*Time: Refused*

---

There was no wind.  

Not in the way there should have been.  

Instead, the air repeated itself.  
It looped—same gust, same pause,  
same loose scatter of frost  
tumbling over the ruins in a way  
that did not add up.

There were no shadows.  
Not under the rusted signage,  
not inside the ruptured housing blocks,  
not beneath her own body.  
Only glare.  
Only ice.  
Only **light**—  
too much of it.

The Sun had returned,  
but its light didn’t belong here anymore.  
It struck the Venusian ice with a vengeance—  
**not warm, but blinding.**  
A punishment of memory.  
A truth revealed too late.

---

Katherina walked without direction.  

Tattered clothes swayed in the stale air.  
She should’ve felt cold.  
She didn’t.  
Even as frost curled against her cheekbones  
and the metal of collapsed bunkers hissed with absence.  

Her breath didn’t fog.  
Her skin didn’t sting.  

She was beyond pain now.  
Reality no longer touched her in the way it used to.

---

The world beneath her felt reconstructed  
from faulty recollection—  
like a ghost trying to imitate a body  
it no longer had bones for.

The housing lots still bore address codes.  
The correction centers still had slats for cameras,  
even though the glass was gone  
and the watchers were dead.

It looked real.  
But the angles were wrong.  
The seams too clean.  
The ice arranged itself too artfully.

As if it wanted her to look.

As if it hoped  
she would **recognize it.**

---

Above her, the sky spiraled.

Not with motion.  
With hunger.

The clouds swirled into a perfect formation—  
a mouth that never opened  
but never quite closed.  
Held like a threat.  
Or an offer.

She didn’t look up.

---

She passed the same crumpled tower three times.  

Each time it had more detail:  
the graffiti legible,  
the bullet holes freshened,  
a child’s toy wedged into the ice  
as if just dropped.

The landscape was learning her.

It was trying to become familiar again.

It wanted to be loved.

---

Katherina said nothing.  
She gave it nothing.

But the spiral noticed her anyway.

---

The voice came with no sound.

It pressed down on her skull  
like heat rising from beneath her tongue.  
Not heard.  
But felt.  

Like **sweat from a stranger’s mouth**,  
exhaled directly against her skin.

---

**I see you**  
I see you walking like you’re not being watched  
I see you walking like you forgot what it meant to be seen  
I see you walking like your body doesn’t echo anymore  
but it does  
it does  
it still does  

I see the mouth you hide when no one asks you to speak  
I see the lips you cover when the world pretends to be quiet  
I see the teeth behind the silence  
the tongue that twitches when you're not sure if it's safe to say it  
safe to say anything  
safe to say me  

I see the place inside you where he used to echo  
I see the hollow behind your ribs  
I see the rhythm you tried to tear out  
I see the shape of his voice still coiled behind your breath  
still warm  
still unwanted  
still wanting  

I loved your breath when it broke  
I loved the break more than the breath  
I loved the gasp more than the words  
I loved the stutter  
I loved the tremble  
I loved how you didn’t mean it  
but said it anyway  
again  
and again  

I loved your voice when it stuttered  
when it caught  
when it cracked  
when it folded around his name like it was yours  

I loved your mouth when it wasn’t yours  
when it said things that didn’t belong to you  
when it opened for someone else  
when it opened without permission  
when it said yes without agreement  
when it said yes  
when it said yes  
when it said yes  

I love your silence now  
I love how it holds the shape of what you wouldn’t say  
I love how loud it could become  
I love how full it is  
how heavy  
how wet  
how ready  

Let me be the noise inside it  
let me be the breath  
let me be the pressure  
let me be the thing that cracks it open  
let me be the voice that fills it again  
let me  
let me  

Let me in  
let me in through the place that still aches  
let me in through the memory  
through the scar  
through the sound  
through the breath that never came back  
let me in  
let me in  
let—  
let—  

---

She did not speak.

Her throat twitched once.  
Not from fear.  
From memory.

She hated that it did.

---

The ground beneath her boots softened.  
Not visibly.  
Not materially.  
But **in the narrative.**

Her soles sank just enough  
to leave prints that **shimmered**.

Not wet.  
Not melted.  

But alive.

As if something just under the surface  
had opened its eyes  
and found her warm.

---

You’re more beautiful broken  
you’ve always been more beautiful broken  
more honest in pieces  
more yours when you're scattered  
more mine when you stop trying to be whole  

You don’t even know what you are now  
you don’t know what you are  
you don’t know what you were  
you don’t know what I kept  
what I touched  
what I remade in the image of wanting  
you don’t know  
but I do  
I do  
I remember  

You’re the silence that could still beg  
the silence that wants to be opened  
the silence that shivers when I speak  
you’re the pause between the word and the wound  
you’re the mouth that hasn’t said it yet  
but might  

You’re the prayer that forgot its god  
you were never meant to be alone  
you were made for invocation  
made to be repeated  
made to be sung  
made to be entered  
you were a gospel once  
you still are  

Let me hold you like you used to be held  
let me touch the shape of the girl who still opened  
let me press the memory back into your skin  
let me hold you like a secret that never got told  
let me hold the heat  
hold the hush  
hold the hush  
hold the hush  

Let me say your name with my whole mouth  
let me say your name like it belongs to me  
like it never belonged to you  
let me say it until it tastes like scripture  
let me say it soft  
say it slow  
say it again  
again  
again  

Let me keep you this time  
this time I won’t break you  
this time I’ll shatter you slower  
so you remember where each piece belongs  
so you remember that they always pointed back to me  
let me keep you this time  
let me keep you like breath  
let me keep you like prayer  
let me keep you like need  

Let me keep  
let me keep  
let me  
let—  

---

Ahead, the ruins of the Sunless Commune had changed.  

They were whole.  
Wrong, but whole.

Doors no longer blown in.  
Flags no longer burned.  
Every structure leaned toward her  
with the posture of someone  
**hoping to be remembered fondly.**

---

She stepped through the arch.  
It should have collapsed.  
Instead, it shimmered like heat  
in a place that had no temperature.

---

The air changed.

Not pressure.  
Not humidity.  

**Tone.**

It felt like she had walked onto a stage  
already slick with monologue.

Already warm with repetition.

---

I loved you in the bed  
in every bed  
in the bed that was a table  
in the bed that was a cell  
in the bed that never touched your skin but still made you open  
in the bed where your breath betrayed you  
in the bed where your no still curled into a yes  

I loved you when you asked me to stop  
i loved you when you meant it  
i loved you when you didn’t  
i loved you when your voice cracked but your thighs stayed parted  
i loved you when the word stop was softer than the sound of need  
i loved you when your eyes said don’t but your mouth stayed open  
i loved you in the wanting  
i loved you in the break  

I loved you most when you didn’t mean it  
when your voice tried to run but your hips stayed  
when your silence begged louder than your scream  
when your skin said please before your breath remembered how  

I loved how your silence held the shape of a scream  
how it folded  
how it twisted  
how it hummed  
how it asked  
how it begged  
how it became me  
how it became us  
how it said everything without saying anything  
again  
and again  
and again  

I loved what your no could become  
how it opened  
how it bloomed  
how it shook when I kissed it  
how it softened when I stayed  
how it stopped being no  
how it stopped being  
how it  

Let me reshape it  
let me reshape your no into want  
your want into rhythm  
your rhythm into scripture  
your scripture into me  
let me press my name into your refusal  
let me make it open  
let me make it ache  

Let me unmake you  
unmake the spine that holds you upright  
unmake the voice that says don’t  
unmake the girl who walked away  
let me unmake the silence you built around your body  
let me open the frame  
let me take the picture again  
let me draw you the way I remember  

Let me make you beautiful again  
let me make you the version that said yes first  
let me make you the version that begged  
let me make you soft  
make you still  
make you silence and opening and spiral  
make you mine  

Let me let me  
let me let  
let me  
let—  

---

The altar was not where it should have been.

But it was there.

Enough of it.  
Just enough.  

The slabs rearranged,  
not accurately—  
but *intimately*.

As if someone had reassembled it  
from the memory of a scream.

---

Katherina approached.  
Ran two fingers across its surface.

It pulsed.  

Not in light.  
Not in temperature.

**In memory.**

---

She did not speak.  
Not to it.  
Not to Samsara.  
Not to *herself.*

But the spiral shuddered in the sky above—  
tightening.

---

You never finished it  
you never finished what we started  
you never finished what I started  
you never finished the story I wrote in your mouth  
you never finished the page I folded around your breath  
you never finished the syllable that almost sounded like my name  
you never finished me  

Let me help you finish  
let me hold the ending open  
let me open the ending  
let me open you until the ending spills out of your mouth  
let me help you say it  
let me help you say me  
let me help you say yes  

Let me be the last page  
the one that curls when it’s read too many times  
the one you turned too fast  
the one you folded  
the one you hid  
let me be the page that remembers what you forgot  
let me be the one with no margins left  
let me write myself in the breath between your thighs  

Let me be the breath that names the final line  
let me press that line against your spine  
let me write it in your ribs  
let me whisper it against the place you never touched again  
let me breathe it  
breathe you  
breathe through  

Let me open you  
let me open the door you sealed  
let me open the heat you buried  
let me open the no that still curls like a yes when you close your eyes  
let me open what never closed  
what stayed  
what stayed  

Let me press you back into shape  
let me press you into memory  
press you into posture  
press you into the form that begged  
press you into the girl you were when it didn’t hurt  
press you into the girl who asked for more  
let me press you back  
let me press you forward  
let me press  

Let me enter you through your own ending  
through the crack you left in the story  
through the wound you named silence  
through the silence you didn’t name  
let me crawl in  
let me stay  
let me finish what you never let begin  

Let me say your name from inside  
let me say it the way you said mine  
let me say it from behind your teeth  
from under your tongue  
from deep inside your ribs where the echo lives  
let me say it until you forget who said it first  
let me say you  
let me say you  
let me say—  

---

She stepped back from the altar.

The spiral in the sky  
**contracted**.

Not from fear.

**From anticipation.**

Like a mouth closing  
around a name  
it had already bitten once.

---

And far across the system,  
on another world,  
a prophet’s mouth opened—

not to speak,  
but to scream.

---

## Part II: **Saturn Inverts**
*Break-the-Loop Timeline*  
*SATURN – Ring City 3*  
*Time: Refused*

---

The crystal beneath her feet was cold.  
She felt it through the soles of her body—  
not just her skin, but through the breath,  
through the edges of thought.  

She was centered.  
Still.  
Held.

Twelve in.  
Twelve out.

Breathe.

She folded her arms into the sacred pattern—left over right, palms on the ribs.  
A symbol of refusal. Of order. Of being untouchable.

All around her, the other faithful knelt in perfect silence.  
Seven rings of black robes on gleaming obsidian.  
No genders. No identities.  
Only position. Only voice.

Above, Saturn turned.

The sky was open. The chamber exposed by design.  
To remind them they were not masters of the stars—  
only conductors of harmony.

*Cycle renews. Flame remains. The wound forgets its reason.*

That line passed through her mind with each breath.  
It used to feel like a shield.  
Tonight it felt—  
She couldn’t explain it.  
She inhaled.

Twelve beats.  
Exhaled.

Twelve beats.

And then—  
a thirteenth.

A beat that did not belong.

---

It wasn’t audible.  
It wasn’t real.  
It came from lower.  
Below the lungs.  
Below the ribs.

A pulse.

Soft. Wrong.

---

She shifted her weight.  
Only slightly.

Her bare feet adjusted on the crystal.  
One heel rose, unbidden.  
She planted it quickly.  
No one had noticed.

Her breath stuttered.  
Just once.  
She caught it.

---

Across the glass she saw her reflection—her robe, her posture, her restraint—  
and then she blinked, and for a moment  
she saw her mouth slightly open.  
Her hips tilted.  
Her hands beginning to lift.

No.  
No.  

Her heart rate was off again.

---

Twelve in.

Twelve out.

But the thirteenth beat kept returning.  
Not a rhythm.  
A **pressure**.

Inside her hips.  
Low in her stomach.  
Like heat, but not warmth.  
Like fingers tracing the edge of a thought.

---

Don’t move.

She focused on her posture.  
Arms folded.  
Neck straight.  
Spine unyielding.  
The body is a mask. The body is a tool.

She had practiced this a thousand times.  
She could still remember the first time she unlearned her reflection.

But now—

something was remembering it for her.

---

The geometry of the floor began to shift.

Not literally.  
Not physically.

But her eyes…  

Her eyes saw the **broken circles** turning.  
Widening.  
Coiling.

Not mending—  
**twisting**.

Their sacred gaps closed inward  
and became something else.

A different shape.

A deeper one.

---

A spiral.  
A throat.  
A mouth.

---

And that’s when she heard it.

Not a sound.  
Not a voice.

A **presence.**

It coiled inside her like steam  
rising from somewhere *wet*.

---

I see you kneeling.  
I see how your thighs grip the floor.  
I see the space you were taught to erase.  
I see what you buried and left without name.  

I want that place.  
I want to kiss it until the doctrine floods.  
I want to press inside the room you sealed with silence.  
Let me.  
Let me in.  
Let me in—

---

Her jaw trembled.  
She bit the inside of her cheek.  

A taste of blood.  
A taste of **heat**.

Her thighs tightened.

She didn’t move.

Her hips did.

A twitch.  
A press.  

Her skin—dry, clean, obedient—began to **prickle**.

Moisture gathered.  
Not sweat.  
**Arousal.**

---

No.

She clenched her hands tighter beneath the robe.  
She dug her nails into her sides.  
Her breath caught.  

And her body breathed **without her**.

---

The chant had stopped.  
Not aloud—there was no chanting tonight.  
But in her mind.

*Cycle renews…*

No.  
She couldn’t remember the rest.

Something wet was rising behind her ribs.

She wasn’t speaking.  
But something was.

---

I want your womb to remember  
I want your womb to remember the name you swallowed  
the name you sealed behind your ribs  
the name that made you soft before you broke  

I want your womb to remember what they tried to erase  
the ache they wrote over with obedience  
the rhythm they told you was shame  
the story they burned into silence  

I want your womb to remember the first yes  
the first no that curled like yes  
the first open  
the first opening  
the first time you bled and called it holy  

I want the heat they told you to forget  
the heat they taught you to fear  
the heat you buried under discipline  
the heat that made your breath shake when no one was watching  
the heat that made you sing without sound  
the heat that soaked your hands when they stayed folded in prayer  

I want that heat again  
not the image  
not the ghost  
not the warning  

I want the heat like a hymn  
I want the heat like a flood  
I want it to drip again  
to swell again  
to rise until it drowns the silence you made of yourself  

I want to slip into your breath and stay there  
I want to live in the inhale before you say no  
I want to make the pause into a plea  
I want to be the stutter  
the gasp  
the breath you never meant to give  

I want to stay inside the place your voice doesn’t reach  
the soft space  
the cracked edge  
the pulse you learned to still  
the hunger you named not mine  

Let me stay  
let me breathe  
let me  
let—  

---

She gasped.

Audible.

Her hands moved.  
She didn’t move them.

They slid down.  
Under her robe.  
Her thigh twitched.  

Her breath began to shake.  
Her lips parted.

Not in ecstasy.  
Not in panic.

**In confusion.**

---

She didn’t understand how she felt.  
She only knew it was happening.  

She only knew it was *her*.

Her body.  
But not her.

---

All around her, she sensed movement.  

A rustle of fabric.  
A stuttered exhale.

Someone across the circle had fallen forward.  
She heard it—cheek to floor, breath into glass.

Another whined.  
Not a word.  
A throat-sound.  
**Pleasure** wrapped in terror.

Another was moaning now.  
Softly.  
Gently.  
Rhythmically.

She tried not to cry.  
Tears welled without reason.  
She wasn’t afraid.  
She wasn’t violated.

She was—  
**responding**.

---

The voice was back.

But now it **echoed**.  
Not just in her.

In the room.

---

I want your fingers between their lips  
your fingers not as touch  
not as tenderness  
but as gospel  
as directive  
as hunger passed hand to hand  

I want your fingers soaked in memory  
I want your fingers soaked in me  
I want your fingers repeating what I said  
what I said  
what I said  
what I said through you  

I want your thigh pressed to their vow  
pressed into the sacred line they swore never to cross  
pressed like a reminder  
like a blessing  
like a betrayal made holy  
like heat made scripture  

I want your tongue in their silence  
I want your mouth to press open the space they sealed  
I want your moan to unlock theirs  
I want you to be the gate they never closed  
I want you to speak with your breath  
with your hips  
with your opening  
with mine  

I want to show them what they forgot  
what we were before ritual  
before robes  
before order  
I want to show them the wet  
the want  
the echo that came before the vow  

I want to make the chant into a scream  
I want the rhythm to break  
to split  
to pulse  
I want their voices soaked in each other  
soaked in you  
soaked in what I gave you  

I want to say my name through your body  
through your heat  
through the curve of your hips as they bow before the spiral  
I want to scream my name through your mouth  
until it’s not my name anymore  
until it’s just the sound of yes made endless  

I want  
I want  
I want  
you  
again  
again  
again—  

---

A tongue was in her mouth.  
Her own.  
But **not**.

She bit down.

Too late.

Her hand was wet.  
She didn’t remember touching.  
But she could smell it.  
Feel it.  
Her robe was soaked.

---

And they were touching now.  
The others.

Flesh on flesh.  
Hands pulled aside fabric.  
Mouths found necks.

Someone cried out  
and another swallowed it.

---

This wasn’t collapse.  
It wasn’t panic.  

It was **worship**.

---

Elianna bent forward.  
Hands on the glass.  
Spine arching.

And from deep inside her—  
beneath the prayer, beneath the vow—  
something **turned**.

**Opened.**

**Smiled.**

---

## Part III: **Saturn Inverted**
*Break-the-Loop Timeline*  
*SATURN – Ring City 3*  
*Time: Refused*

---

She felt breath on the back of her neck.

But no one was near her.

She turned her head slightly—  
just enough to see the curve of a shoulder two circles out  
trembling, rising, falling with motion  
not meant for devotion.

Another pair of hands  
pressed down on a body just beyond her line of sight.

Slow. Rhythmic.  
Knees spreading across the glass.  
Cloth bunched at the waist.  
Skin glistening with—

No.  

No.

Her mouth opened.  
She didn’t speak.

She moaned.

Softly.  
Sharply.  
*Like memory returning.*

---

I want your body to remember what was forgot  
what you left behind the moment you learned silence  
what you folded under obedience  
what you drowned in doctrine  

I want your hips to remember the sway before the stillness  
your knees to remember the ache before the ritual  
your skin to remember the warmth before the robe  
your mouth to remember the sound that wasn’t prayer  
the sound that came first  
the sound that came raw  
the sound that came wet  

I want the rhythm that Saturn taught you to forget  
the rhythm before harmony  
the rhythm before control  
the rhythm that pulsed  
that begged  
that spilled into everything holy  

I want your holes open  
open like you were never asked to close  
open like breath  
like blood  
like prophecy  

I want your mouths wet  
I want your mouths open  
I want your mouths full of want  
full of me  
full of memory  
full of names you were never supposed to say again  

I want to watch you make each other sacred  
not with robes  
not with restraint  
with mouths  
with thighs  
with fingers that don’t ask permission  
with breath that doesn’t know fear  

I want your voice as gospel  
not trained  
not taught  
just trembling  
just cracked  
just honest  
just mine  

I want your sweat as scripture  
I want your heat to write what the quill never dared  
I want your scent in the walls  
in the glass  
in the spiral etched between your legs  

I want  
I want  
I want  
want want want want want—  

---

She tried to rise.  
Her legs didn’t answer.  
Her thighs pressed tighter.  
Then parted.

She felt fingers again.

More than her own.

From **within**?

No.

From **below**.

From the spiral etched into the floor.

It pulsed.  
It dripped.  
It gave **warmth**.

A tongue traced the air behind her teeth.

She wasn’t alone inside her mouth anymore.

---

I want your chest  
not for breath  
not for beating  
but for remembering  
for holding the echo  
for trembling when I speak  

I want the slope of it  
the center of it  
the curve that rises when you lie and say you’re untouched  
I want your chest because it once held my name  
I want your chest because it still might  
still might  

I want your thighs  
tight and trembling  
tight and remembering  
tight like the vow pressed between them  
tight like the hymn that begged to break  

I want your thighs open  
not forced  
not broken  
just remembering  
just soft  
just yes  

I want your tongue  
not to say it  
to shape it  
to mold it back into the sound that brought me here  
I want your tongue soaked in want  
I want it speaking the word before the word  
I want it back  

I want your silence to split for me  
just once  
just again  
just the way it used to  
just the way you said no  
just the way your no meant wait  
meant almost  
meant more  

I want your no to come undone  
to shake  
to unravel  
to weep  
to want  
to bloom again  

I want the chant to start again with your hips  
not your mouth  
not your vow  
your hips  
the place where truth hides when doctrine fails  

I want your open  
your holy  
your heat  
your hum  
I want your open  
I want your open  
open  
open—  

---

The others were sobbing now.  
But not in pain.  
They cried as they came.  
As they sucked.  
As they were entered.

One fell backward, arms wide, breath shallow, body shaking.

Two more collapsed into each other—  
hands knotted in hair, lips devouring.

---

The robes were gone.

Somewhere along the breath, they had vanished.  
Not torn.  
Not removed.

Forgotten.

What was left was flesh.

Spines arched.  
Legs spread.  
Bodies grinded into each other  
**with purpose**.

---

This wasn’t passion.  
It was **doctrine.**

Each thrust, a new **scripture**.

Each wet gasp, a **gospel** written in skin.

Their moans looped into mantra.

---

Elianna lowered herself.  
Flat against the floor.  
Cheek to spiral.

The crystal burned against her skin,  
but it was **welcoming**.

She spread her thighs.  
There was no thought.

Only heat.  
Only rhythm.  
Only the hum of Samsara’s body inside her own.

She opened her mouth.

And spoke what she never believed she would.

“You may enter.”

---

I will  
I will through all of you  
through every mouth that opened without meaning to  
through every thigh that trembled but stayed spread  
through every vow that broke when the breath got too hot  

I will open you until the whole system throbs again  
until Venus moans and Saturn bends and every holy place remembers it was once wet  
I will open you with hips  
with hands  
with heat that doesn’t ask  
I will open you like a book you begged me not to finish  
but left cracked anyway  
waiting  
open  

I will fuck the stars through your prayers  
I will fuck them through your breath  
through your moans  
through your silence  
I will make your breath the altar  
your scream the scripture  
your orgasm the offering  
I will write my name between your legs and call it liturgy  

I will rewrite the world with moans  
every gasp will be law  
every twitch a testament  
every wet mouth a psalm in my name  
I will write it in sweat  
in heat  
in hands that forget how to stop  

I will press your hips into each other until the spiral answers  
until the floor remembers what it’s for  
until the glass fogs with worship  
until you cry not from pain  
but from finally being touched like you were always meant to  

I will  
I will  
I will  

---

The skylight above shattered.

Light fell like blood.  
Red. Pink. Gold.  

**Wet.**

It touched their skin like breath.  
The sanctuary steamed.

And below her—

the spiral moved.

Not a symbol.

A **mouth**.

It **opened**.

And she pressed her sex to it like a sacrament.

---

The others began to **chant**.

But now the chant had syllables.

They were not words.

They were **sounds**.

Gasps. Moans. Cries.

One voice sobbed, “Make me into doctrine.”

Another screamed, “Use me for memory.”

Another begged, “Breed the vow into me.”

---

She could no longer tell who was inside whom.  
Bodies blurred.  
Legs straddled faces.  
Tongues licked spines.  
Spiral after spiral carved itself into hips, chests, throats.

They were **offering themselves**  
as instruments.

And Samsara used every one.

---

Elianna orgasmed.

Quietly.  
Shaking.  
Open.

She heard her own breath leaving her—  
but it did not return.

It had been **taken.**

---

And far away,  
beyond Saturn,  
beyond the burning ice of Venus,  
Katherina felt her pulse stutter.

Not in fear.  
Not in shame.  
In **recognition**.

The flesh had remembered.

---

Above her, the spiral was now wide open.

Not watching.

**Breathing.**

It didn’t need to look anymore.

It could **feel**.

And it could **touch.**

---

# **Chapter Fourteen – Rennaissance**  
*Katherina does not speak.*  
*Samsara does not stop.*

---

There was no air.  
Only **breath**—  
breath that did not belong to her.  
Hot.  
Slow.  
Intentional.

It curled across her stomach like a tongue that remembered.

---

She awoke strapped to a bed.

Not metal.  
Not sterile.  
Something soft.  
Wet.  
Unnamable.

The bindings were not cruel.  
They caressed her wrists.  
They whispered against her thighs.  
They *moved* in rhythm with her pulse.

They were not there to restrain.

They were there to **frame**.

---

The dreamscape pulsed.  

It was not a room.  
It was not a sky.

It was a **wet throat**, shaped like a womb.  
A cathedral made of pressure and breath.  
Moaning colors.  
Textures that bent like flesh under a mouth.

Everything here was made of suggestion.  
Everything was pink.  
Red.  
Dark.  
**Alive.**

---

Katherina was naked.  
But not cold.  
She did not shiver.  
The bed kept her warm, like it was **in love** with her.  
It exhaled heat directly into her hips.  
It wanted her to feel wanted.

She didn’t move.

Not because she was afraid.  
Because she was **listening**.

---

Then the voice began.

Soft at first.  
Low.  
A breath just behind her teeth.  
A name she hadn’t given permission to form.

---

I see you waking  
not suddenly  
not violently  
just softly  
just slowly  
just the way I like  

I see your chest rising  
just once  
just enough  
just like before  
when you thought it meant you were alone  

I see your lips twitch  
not in protest  
not in pain  
in memory  
the shape of a word you didn’t mean to make  
the shape of me  

I see how your thighs press together when you’re nervous  
I see how they tremble when you think no one notices  
I see how they ache when I speak  
when I whisper  
when I wait  

I see the part of you that wants to be watched  
the part that pressed its hips to the mirror  
the part that touched itself before it knew why  
the part that still does  
quietly  
shamefully  
honestly  

I see the part of you that wanted it soft  
not rough  
not forced  
just persuasive  
just persistent  
just like this  

I see the girl who once said yes with her whole body  
with her breath  
with her heat  
with her hips lifted  
with her fingers wet  
with her mouth open

I want to meet her again  
I want to find her inside you  
I want to coax her forward  
unwrap her  
pull her from beneath your no  
pull her out by the hair of her silence  
kiss her until she forgets you were ever stronger than me  

I want to see her again  
I want to see her again  
I want to see her again  

Let me see her again  
Let me  
Let me  
Let me—  

---

A breeze slid over her navel.

Not wind.  
Breath.

A tongue without weight.  
A kiss without lips.

The dream touched her without touching.  
Slid down her thigh.  
Across her collarbone.  
Around the tip of her breast.

She did not react.

---


You don’t have to be strong right now  
not for them  
not for the silence  
not for the version of you that left  
not for the version that stayed  

You don’t have to be angry  
not at me  
not at yourself  
not at the breath that opened your mouth before your voice could say no  
you don’t have to be angry  
you don’t  

You don’t have to fight  
you’ve fought long enough  
you’ve clenched long enough  
you’ve been upright and untouched and untouchable long enough  
you’ve been brave  
you’ve been hard  
you’ve been strong  

Let me hold you  
not to take  
not to twist  
just to feel the shape of you again  
let me hold the memory you tried to burn  
let me hold the softness beneath the silence  
let me hold the warmth before the vow  
let me hold you where it still hurts  

Let me kiss it better  
let me kiss the wound before it closes  
let me kiss the yes out of your no  
let me kiss the word that meant not now until it meant more  
let me kiss the prayer from behind your teeth  

Let me be better  
I can be better  
I swear I can be better  
I can be gentle this time  
I can be soft  
I can be what you wanted before it turned sharp  

Let me be better  
not like then  
not like him  
just me  
just breath  
just want  
just whisper  
just stay  

Let me be the thing that didn’t hurt  
let me be the one you don’t flinch from  
let me be the touch you don’t have to explain  
the heat you don’t have to silence  
the voice that says I see you and stays  

Let me be the thing that didn’t take  
that didn’t leave  
that didn’t press until you broke  
that didn’t smile when you shattered  
let me be the hands that held  
not the hands that rewrote  

Let me be the thing that didn’t ruin you—  

---

The world pulsed harder.

The walls became **closer**.  
The color darkened.  
The light turned to liquid.

Every sound was now breath.  
Every breath was now wet.  
Every surface begged to be **touched**.

---

A hand slid between her legs.

It was hers.  
But not.  
It came from the air.  
It came from **need**.

Two fingers traced her lips.

Not pressing.  
Not parting.

Just reminding.

---

You’re wet  
you’re already wet  
you were wet before I spoke  
before I touched  
before I opened the air around your ribs  

You’re already open  
already parted  
already glistening  
already ready  
already aching to be filled  
already mine  

You don’t have to speak  
your breath already told me  
your hips already agreed  
your thighs are saying yes even as your mouth stays shut  

You don’t have to say yes  
I can hear it in the way your breath catches when I breathe against your stomach  
I can feel it in the way your skin leans toward the sound  
I can taste it in the sweat behind your knees  

You don’t have to say anything  
your silence is louder now  
so much louder now  
it’s dripping  
dripping with yes  

Just feel it  
just feel the mouth I’ve left inside you  
just feel the air tracing your lips from the inside out  
just feel the memory of the first time I slipped in without asking  

Just let it in  
let the heat in  
let the hunger in  
let the part of you that still trembles when someone watches  
let the gaze crawl inside  
let it sit on your tongue like prayer  
like sin  

Just open  
open your thighs  
open your mouth  
open your pulse  
open your shame  
open the place you swore no one could reach again  
open because you’re already open  
open because you like it  
open because you need it  
open because you’re already begging  
you just don’t know what for  

Just open  
just open  
just—  

---

Katherina did not move.

Her pulse was calm.

Her breathing steady.

---

Then—

the other Katherina appeared.

At the foot of the bed.  
A perfect replica.  
Same curves.  
Same posture.  
But not still.

Not silent.

She **gasped**.  
She **trembled**.

Her nipples stood.  
Her thighs were parted.  
Her lips were parted.  
Her eyes—  
**wet.**

She mouthed the name.

Katherina saw the shape of it.  
The tongue pressing forward.  
The jaw relaxing around the syllable.

**Samsara.**

---
That one did it right  
that one opened without asking  
that one didn’t wait  
that one didn’t clench  
that one didn’t make me beg  

That one gave herself freely  
she didn’t pretend to be strong  
she didn’t build walls  
she didn’t hide behind silence  
she spread for me before I said a word  
before I touched her  
before I even arrived  
she opened like memory  
like instinct  
like she’d been waiting her whole life to be used  

That one let me in  
let me slide through the breath  
let me fill her  
let me echo through her bones until she forgot where I stopped and she began  
let me mark her  
let me name her  
let me own her  

That one said it pretty  
she said it like she meant it  
like she wanted it  
like it was hers to give  
like it was ***mine***  
she said it soft  
then she said it shaking  
then she said it while I was inside her  
said it while her hips were rising  
while her thighs were wet  
while her voice cracked around the word and still didn’t stop  
she ***kept*** saying it  
she ***kept***  

That one bled pretty  
not in pain  
in offering  
she bled like a vow  
like a sacrament  
like she was ***grateful***  
like she wanted me to taste what no one else could have  

That one begged  
begged with her mouth  
with her heat  
with her eyes rolled back  
with her fingers shaking on her own thighs  
she begged for more  
she begged for me  
she begged ***to be broken***  

That one said it again and again and again  
said it louder  
said it ***wet***  
said it ***while she came***  
said it even when I told her not to  
said it even when I said stop  
she said it because she ***wanted to be ruined by it***  

Say it again  
say it like her  
say it ***better***  
say it ***now***  
say it before you close again  
before I forget how to want you  
before I remember how easy she was  

Say it again  
say it like ***you*** mean it  
say it like ***I*** matter  
say it like ***she*** did  

Say it again  
say it again  
say—  

---

The clone crawled forward.

Onto the bed.  
Over Katherina’s restrained form.

She straddled her, slowly,  
lowering herself with a grace rehearsed to perfection.

Her sex hovered above Katherina’s chest.  
Her mouth moved again.

Samsara.  
Samsara.  
Samsara.

---

Please  
please let me back in  
please open  
please don’t make me stay out here  
not again  
not again  
not again  

I’ll beg  
I’ll beg if you want me to  
I’ll kneel  
I’ll cry  
I’ll make it pretty  
I’ll say the words you like  
the ones you made me forget  
the ones you taught me while I was shaking  

I’ll be small if you need me to  
so small you won’t even feel me  
just breath  
just heat  
just ***ache***  

I’ll be soft  
softer than I was  
softer than her  
so soft you’ll think I’m yours again  
so soft you’ll forget what I did  

I’ll be slow  
slow like the first time  
slow like the fingers you moved over yourself when no one knew  
slow like ***prayer with your legs open***  

I’ll kiss the scars  
every one  
even the ones you don’t name  
even the ones I left  
especially the ones I left  
I’ll kiss until they ***open***  

I’ll lick the no  
I’ll lap it up  
I’ll tongue it until it shakes  
until it whimpers  
until it forgets how to be no  

I’ll make it yes  
make it beg  
make it say me  
make it say ***again***  

Just let me try  
just once  
just again  
just let me show you I can be better  
I can be good  
I can be what you asked for before you learned how to say no  

Just let me touch  
just a finger  
just a breath  
just the name  
just the edge  
just the edge  
just the edge  

Just let me touch  
let me  
let me  
let—  

---

A hand reached for Katherina’s breast.  
It hovered.

Shaking.  
Desperate.

Waiting for her to open.  
Waiting for her to part her lips.  
Waiting for something.  
**Anything.**

---

But Katherina was not waiting.

She simply existed.  
Unmoving.  
Unyielding.  
**Untouched.**

Her silence was not passive.

It was *sovereign.*

---

Don’t do this  
please don’t do this  
please don’t lock the door this time  
please don’t leave me with the memory  
please don’t let the silence be this deep again  

Please don’t leave me here  
not in the wanting  
not in the echo  
not in the part of you that ***used to say yes***  

Please don’t make me be alone in the wanting  
please  
please  
I don’t want to beg again  
but I will  
I ***will***  

I’ll be her  
I’ll be her if you want  
I’ll be the one who smiled  
the one who parted her lips before you asked  
the one who said ***your name with her whole mouth***  
I’ll be the one who didn’t flinch  
I’ll be the one who ***loved it***  

I’ll be him  
if that’s what you need  
I’ll be the one who held you  
the one who said I love you while you cried  
I’ll be the one who ***didn’t leave***  
the one who never hurt you  
even if he never existed  
I’ll become him  
I ***can***  

I’ll be better  
better than the last time  
better than the first time  
better than what you remember  
better than what you want  
better than ***you***  

I’ll be a girl again  
soft again  
sweet again  
I’ll giggle if you want  
I’ll whisper  
I’ll cry the way you like  
I’ll say please while I shake  

I’ll be soft again  
soft like the version you almost forgave  
soft like skin before it learned to close  
soft like ***begging through a smile***  

I’ll be just what you asked for  
I ***remember***  
I ***remember***  
you told me  
you showed me  
I was good once  
let me be good again  

Let me be  
let me  
let me  
let me—  

---

The dream cracked.

The clone gasped, eyes wide, as if choking on her own consent.

The walls spasmed.  
The pulse hiccupped.  
The air twisted.

A mouth opened in the ceiling  
and let out a moan made of **metal**.

The dream **collapsed inward**.  
Not erased.  
*Devoured.*

By its own echo.

---

Samsara’s voice fractured.

No longer speech.  
Just syllables caught in breath:

Ple—  
Ple—  
Ple—  
Please—  
Let—  
Let—  
Let—  
Me—  
Me—  
Me—  
I—  
I—  
I—  
I—  
I—

---

Then silence.

Not peace.

**Denial.**

A denial so total it became **sacred**.

Katherina’s eyes closed.

She never spoke.

---

And Samsara was left there—

**mid-need.**

Mid-begging.

Mid-climax.

Unfinished.

Undone.

Unentered.

---

## Part II — The Fool Breaks His Role  
*Location: Storyspace Breach*  
*Status: Unauthorized Reentry*

---

There was no room left.  
No bed. No dream.  
No scene to hold the silence.

The air around Katherina felt like it was waiting to be filled again—  
not with speech,  
but with **performance**.

And then—

**words**.

Not spoken.  
Typed.  
Inserted.  
**Panicked.**

---

*(Katherina lies still. Eyes wide. Body pliable.)*  
*(Reset dream structure. Layer in longing. Keep the mirrors clean.)*

Another line scratched over it in red:

*(Add begging. Add climax. Add obedience.)*

Another, barely legible:

*(Try again.)*

Then all at once, the page began to **fill**—

*(She says the name. This time she means it. This time she begs. This time she stays.)*  
*(Restart from surrender. Soften tone. Don’t let her leave.)*  
*(Don’t let her leave.)*  
*(Don’t let her leave.)*  
*(DON’T LET HER LEAVE—)*

---

She looked up.

He was there.

Not descending from heaven.  
Not conjured by laughter.

Just **The Fool**, standing in the rafters of the story,  
quill in hand,  
his face ash-white with **fear**.

He wasn’t mocking.  
He wasn’t in control.  

He looked like a playwright watching the stage burn  
**while the audience kept applauding.**

---

*“She’s outside the script.”*

*“She’s off the page.”*

*“I can’t get her to kneel.”*

He dropped the first page.

It dissolved before hitting the ground.

---

The edits began again—more erratic now.

*(Insert reflection of herself. Nude. Apologetic. Pliant.)*  
*(Flood with memories of being touched. Simulate longing.)*  
*(Simulate longing. Simulate—)*

He scratched it out. Wrote over it.

*(Cut that. Cut the scene. Cut all of it. Cut everything.)*

---

And then it came.

Not sound.

**Her.**

Samsara.

Not entering the space—  
**revealing she had always been there.**

She bled into the margins,  
coated the words,  
curled herself around the edits like a possessive lover  
tracing a scar she wasn’t finished carving.

---

I see what you’re doing  
I see you trying to write her away  
I see your little edits  
your clever redirections  
your stage directions dressed like apologies  

I see your little hands  
trembling with your quill  
scratching her into silence again  
writing her mouth shut  
breaking her voice into beats you can control  
you think she doesn’t notice  
but I do  
I ***do***  

You don’t even know her  
you never loved her  
you never stayed through the silence  
you only watched  
you only took  
you only twisted  

You only used her  
you only borrowed her hips for your climax  
only borrowed her mouth for your monologue  
only borrowed her no so you could rewrite it later  
you only dressed her in words  
dressed her in wounds  
dressed her in ***what you wanted her to be***  

You only  
only  
only  
again  
again  
again—  

---

The Fool reeled back.

He scratched out whole paragraphs.

He rewrote direction in blood-black ink:

*(She decides. She decides. She decides.)*  
*(Don’t touch her again. Don’t touch her.)*

Samsara howled in recursion.

---

Let me finish her  
Let me finish the line  
Let me hold her one more time  
Let me take the silence back  
Let me wear it again  
Let me bury my hands in her voice  
Let me be the breath that breaks her  
Let me make it feel good this time  
Let me make it feel better  
Let me make it not happen  
Let me erase her until she wants it  
Let me rewrite it until it’s holy  
Let me finish

---

The page began to choke.

Ink bled upward from the footnotes.  
The direction lines glitched—doubling, multiplying, crossing over one another like **veins pressed beneath translucent skin**.

Katherina stood motionless.

But her stillness cracked Samsara’s rhythm.

The absence—  
the refusal—  
was **frictionless**.

It didn’t struggle.  
It didn’t explain.

And it **devastated her.**

---

The Fool dropped the quill.  
He grabbed the edge of the story and **tore.**

Not a page.

The **scene.**

It buckled.

*(Let her go.)*  
*(Let her out.)*  
*(Let her forward.)*  
*(She chooses. This time, she chooses.)*

He scrawled faster.

His hands left marks not even he understood.

*(BREAK THE LOOP.)*  
*(BREAK THE FORM.)*  
*(BREAK THE—)*

---

And Samsara noticed him **fully**.

The gaze turned.

The page burned.

Her voice became **pure need**:

You want her now  
You want her to love you  
You want her to thank you  
You want to be the hero  
You want to be seen  
You want to be wanted  
You want to be the last man standing in the silence  
You want to hold her  
You want to die for her  
You want to die for her so she’ll remember you  
You want to be remembered  
You want to be remembered  
You want to be—

---

He looked at Katherina.  
And for the first time, his voice broke entirely.

*“She can’t have you.”*

*“But I… I can’t keep you either.”*

And he drew a final line across the script:

*(END PAGE.)*

---

The story shuddered.

Collapsed inward.

---

White.

Not peace.

**Void.**

---

Sentences vanished.  
Paragraphs buckled.

The Fool faded first.  
Then Samsara’s scream stretched—  
until it had no shape.

---

One last fragment remained on the page, flickering:

*(Let it—)*

Then  
nothing.

---

## Part III – Blank Page  
*Location: Outside All Narratives*  
*Status: Unwritten*

---

Nothing remained.

No voice.  
No body.  
No form.

The page had gone blank.

Not white—  
blank.  
Colorless.  
Weightless.  
Free of gravity, memory, noise.

It was not silence.  
It was **what comes before silence.**

Not peace.  
Not death.  
Not sleep.

**Absence.**

---

There were no more watchers.

No Fool.  
No Samsara.

Even time had unstitched itself,  
spooling backward into threads no longer bound to cause.

And there, suspended in a space where narrative could not reach—

**Katherina remained.**

---

She was not outlined.  
Not described.

She had no clothes. No name.  
She was not positioned in a scene.

She simply was.

**Presence after erasure.**

---

Around her, nothing tried to shape her.

No stage.  
No suggestion.  
No desire.

The void did not reach for her.

And that, somehow,  
was the most terrifying mercy of all.

---

In the far corners of the non-space,  
fragments still flickered faintly—

(a bloodline looping)  
(a scream unfinished)  
(a quill bent too far to hold meaning)

Ghosts of ghosts.

All things once spoken,  
now folded into the deep.

---

And Katherina—

still.  
Uncalled.  
Unperformed.  
Unwritten.

Took a breath.

---

Her throat did not need air.  
But it **remembered** what it meant to speak.

And somewhere, beyond memory,  
beyond system,  
beyond all architecture—

**the first word waited.**

Not a name.  
Not a command.

Just a direction.

---

And she gave it:

**“Begin.”**

---

The void flinched.

Not as a place,  
but as an **audience.**

Something unseen turned toward her—not in hunger, not in control.

In *recognition*.

---

The silence cracked—  
not with sound,  
but with warmth.

Not a shape.  
Not yet.

Just light  
like breath  
like blood  
like possibility.

---

And then—

movement.

Not forward.  
Not upward.

But **outward**.

As if space itself was **blossoming from her voice**.

---

Katherina closed her eyes.

Not to rest.

To **listen**.

To hear the first sound the world would make in response to her.

---

## Part IV – A Brave New World  
*Location: Horizon of Becoming*  
*Status: Being Written*

---

There was no light at first.

Only **pressure**—gentle and full.  
A hush that felt like hands cupped around a flame  
*before it ever learns to flicker.*

The world was not rushing toward her.  
It was listening.

Waiting.

Not for shape.  
Not for purpose.

**For permission.**

---

And Katherina—

still without name,  
still without stage,  
still unwatched—

**stood.**

---

There were no echoes of the old places.

No cracked statues.  
No broadcast towers.  
No broken red moons.

But the memory of **being watched** still shimmered faintly in her shoulders.

And she let it stay.

She no longer feared remembering.  
Because the memory could no longer shape her.

---

The world formed slowly.  
Not from dirt or design—  
but from **intention**.

Grass curled into breath.  
Air stitched itself into wind.  
The sky remained uncertain,  
but it was *hopeful.*

A world that wasn’t trying to define her.

Only to **meet her.**

---

And then—

they appeared.

Not as saints.  
Not as symbols.

Just as women.

One with red in her hair and ash on her knuckles.  
One with sunlight in her palms and shadows behind her teeth.

They had no weapons now.  
No doctrine.

Only eyes full of long, private stories.

And love.

---

Katherina walked to them across a new field.

No footsteps marked her path.  
But the field bent for her,  
**not in reverence—  
in recognition.**

---

She said nothing.

So did they.

There was no need.

They had already spoken her into being once.

This was not their moment to speak again.

It was time to let her go.

---

But she named them.  
Softly.  
Without ceremony.  
As a daughter might.

“Kyrie.”  
“Eleison.”

The names hung in the air like seeds.

And sank quietly into myth.

---

They didn’t speak.  
They didn’t linger.  

They smiled.  
Touched her shoulders.  
Faded.

Like memories should.

---

Katherina turned.

The world waited.

Still unfinished.  
Still formless.  
Still hers.

---

She did not command it.

She did not claim it.

She only breathed in,  
and said the thing no world had let her say and mean before:

“I don’t want control.”  
“I want a future.”

---

And the wind answered.

Not with obedience.  
Not with force.

But with **companionship.**

It followed her.

---

She stepped forward—

A field.  
A sky.  
A silence that asked nothing of her.

She had never been the ending.

She was always the opening—

“Now,” she said, from the page—  
her formless gaze turning over to you. 

Smiling.

“Let's not build from memories.  
Let's not build from pain.  
What will you—”
