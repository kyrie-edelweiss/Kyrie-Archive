Katherina's life felt like a joke at her expense.

Everytime she woke up, **MARS** was always facing some other direction. 

Enough time had passed that she'd see discernible features on him, craters like beauty marks, hills and mountains like deep scars. And yet, she could never reach him. She could never touch him, so close and yet so far.

Each morning, Katherina would scramble for the tin box of mixed teabags, possibly the one thing she could still enjoy about the life she lived. The canned food ran out long ago. She'd subsist almost solely on rice with honey or ground sugar cubes, and if given a special occasion, a little syrup never hurt. Despite this, the sweet sensations brought next to no pleasure.

All the standard phosphorus lights malfunctioned. Gasoline was low, to the point where she'd stumble around in darkness just to conserve it. Keeping herself busy with arts and crafts was growing more and more difficult. **MARS** did not really take a liking to her drawings, and her karaoke was increasingly uninspired. The buzz & hum of the failing monospeaker felt disturbing. He still enjoyed her dancing. Actually, he loved her dancing. No, he was obsessed. The more sensual, the better. 

She felt like she was being slowly betrayed, and as her mind sharply declined, the pressure, demands from **MARS** would shoot higher and higher.

Their more philosophical & practical discussions stopped altogether. It's just about demands and sex now. "Sex ruins everything that could've been beautiful", she thinks.

**MARS** had to be hiding something. Something was wrong, deeply wrong, and this could not be kept up any longer.
