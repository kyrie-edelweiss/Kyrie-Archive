> *SERGEI’S JOURNAL*

> **PAGE 3**  
> - *...precipitation’s picking up. I gotta find shelter.*  
> - _It’s been like this for a while. The poor bastards still think there’s anything left in this hellhole. The metal’s all vanished and rusted, the acid rain made sure of that. They come in droves from **SATURN**'s installations, thinking they’ll find jack shit trinkets and baubles from their various cult bullshit here._  
> - *Sometimes they come from other planets with their own stupid good-for-nothing motivations.*  
> - *If the monsoon won’t kill 'em, the heat surely will. Then I loot them.*

> **PAGE 4**  
> - *Life’s good.*  
> - *I carry a pistol, just to be sure. You never know.*  

> **PAGE 9**  
> - *Sometimes they land in the catacombs. Not my problem. I find some of them in shackles. The work of the Seven-Planet Federation, no doubt.*  
> - *Found a survivor camp full of women who were shot to death.*  

> **PAGE 12**  
> - _I found a corpse that didn’t rot._  
> - *It was smiling, still warm, though I know it was dead for days. He had seven circles carved into his chest—like planetary alignments gone wrong.*  
> - *I think he was from Mercury.*  
> - *I left him where I found him. Buried his gun, though. Seemed like the right thing to do.*

> **PAGE 18**  
> - *You fucking guessed it—found more man-murder sites today.*  
> - *This world’s getting to me, and it’s gettin’ bad. Been hearing whispers in the ground for a while. Makes no goddamn sense.*  
> - _They always said the blood of men would rise to the skies one day and become newborn oceans._  
> - _That the soil’s cursed with fossils of some fucked-lookin’ bird people._  
> - _That the sun would one day leave us._  
> - *I don’t think there’s much left in me.*

> **PAGE 23**  
> - _Saw her silhouette on the ridge last night. I thought I was alone out here._

> **PAGE 27**  
> - _**VENUS** isn’t just dying. It’s remembering._  
> - *Something deep under this crust wants to come back.*  
> - *Maybe it already has. Maybe it’s her. The one from the prophecy. That girl. The one who eats names.*  

> **PAGE 32**  
> - *The fire spoke last night.*  
> - *I was burning a carcass, and the smoke bent into words. Told me to drop my name. Said it was rotting me from the inside.*  
> - *I woke up this morning without my voice.*  
> - *Wrote my name over and over in the gravel to try to remember it. It kept changing.*

> **PAGE 33**  
> - _Don’t answer if someone asks you to tell them your name._   
> - *I think I made her angry. I think she knows I wrote all this down.*  
> - *I'm going to bury the journal where the wind doesn’t blow.*  
> - *No more pages. Not if I want to keep my skin.*

> *(This is the final entry. The rest of the journal is blank, except for faint imprints in the paper—as if someone kept writing, without ink, long after the pen dried up.)*
