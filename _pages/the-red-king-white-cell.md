> - *... precipitation's picking up. I gotta find shelter.*
> - _It's been like this for a while. The poor bastards still think there's anything left in this hellhole. The metal's all vanished and rusted, the acid rain made sure of that. They come in droves from **SATURN**'s installations, thinking they'll find jack shit trinkets and baubles from their various cult bullshit here._
> - *Sometimes they come from other planets with their own stupid good-for-nothing motivations.*
> - *If the monsoon won't kill 'em, the heat surely will. Then I loot them.*

> **PAGE 4**
> - *Life's good.*
> - *I carry a pistol, just to be sure. You never know.*

> **PAGE 9**
> - *Sometimes they land in the catacombs. Not my problem. I find some of them in shackles. The work of the Seven-Planet Federation, no doubt.*
> - *Found a survivor camp full of women who were shot to death.*

> **PAGE 18**
> - *You fucking guessed it - found more man-murder sites today.*
> - *This world's getting to me, and it's gettin' bad. Been hearing whispers in the ground for a while. Makes no goddamn sense.* 
> - *They always said the blood of men would rise to the skies one day and become newborn oceans.*
> - *That the soil's cursed with fossils of some fucked-lookin' bird people.*
> - *That the sun would one day leave us.*
> - *I don't think there's much left in me.*
