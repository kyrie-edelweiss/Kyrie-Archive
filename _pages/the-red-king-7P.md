## Period: 8 Years Ago … Year: 1976 … Location: NEPTUNE

A cohort of twelve high-ranking personnel are positioned equidistantly around a long, mirror-polished conference table within a spacious, meticulously curated executive chamber. At the helm, a commanding figure presides—posture poised, hands interlaced with practiced composure.

With an assertive tone and a calibrated smile, she begins.

“I will be conducting roll call while my assistant matches names to faces. Our first official session is now underway. Please respond when your name is called,” the figure announces with firm authority.

She proceeds without pause.

“Anderson. Ayden. Bernstein. Cat. D’Agostino. Green — Are you the art specialist? No? Noted... Jones. Kildare. Lamont. Michael. Suarez. Weiss — Oh, you are the art specialist. Zimmer.”

A brief pause.

“That's everyone? Excellent. Good morning. I am Avery-Mary Edelweiss, executive director of this board. This is William Hertz, my senior strategic officer. Welcome to the first official Seven Planet Committee meeting.”

Her words are crisp, her cadence refined by decades of institutional leadership.

“First, allow me to extend formal commendation. Each of you has demonstrated exceptional performance across high-priority sectors including advanced engineering, capital finance, defense logistics, research, and beyond. Your selection was not incidental—your track records have been reviewed, audited, and validated at the highest levels. Let this moment serve as a rare acknowledgment: your contributions are seen. They are appreciated. Well done.”

A ripple of polite laughter. Applause follows—brief, respectful.

Edelweiss continues, her tone shifting to operational gravity.

“Due to the insurgent forces that have seized control of the Edelweiss Station — and more notably, our critical asset VENUS — as well as their continued acts of violence carried out under the guise of so-called 'sex liberation,' this department has been established with a singular mandate: to dismantle the rising tide of female-led radical extremism,” Edelweiss declares, her tone resolute.

A few nods. Some lean forward. Green emits a quiet whistle. Applause, firmer this time.

“They will not proceed unchecked. We will neutralize their influence and erase the remnants of their uprising, starting from the outermost colonies — **NEPTUNE** — and advancing inward across every planetary jurisdiction under our protection,” she states, gesturing emphatically.

The room breaks into structured applause. Edelweiss signals to her second-in-command.

“I’ll now hand it over to William, who will provide an overview of the planetary situation. He’s a very smart, capable and passionate man.”

William Hertz steps forward with measured authority. A low mechanical hum follows as the **reckorder**, embedded into the ceiling panel, activates. The chamber lights dim slightly. A translucent projection materializes on the wall behind him—clean, minimal, and institutional blue.

> **SLIDE 1 – MERCURY**  
> *(Visual: a scorched, wind-blasted colony; heat-map overlay in red; “Threat Vector: Eliminated”)*
>
> “**MERCURY**: Following a sabotage event targeting atmospheric filtration systems, the colony is currently non-viable,” Hertz begins.  
> “No recovery operations are scheduled. While regrettable, the loss neutralizes a significant threat vector. Reconstruction efforts will prioritize enhanced security infrastructure.”

He pauses. The screen flickers.

> “A moment of silence, please, for all confirmed *client* casualties.”  
> *(The projection dims to a dark gray, displaying a silent counter of names: 841 dead.)*

---

> **SLIDE 2 – VENUS**  
> *(Visual: glitched-out skyline, static interference, **VENUS** symbol. “1966: Total Comms Loss | 1969: Final Withdrawal”)*
>
> “**VENUS**: The situation is critical,” Hertz states, the image casting red light across the conference chamber.
>
> “This was the epicenter of the uprising. Communications ceased entirely in 1966. All management infrastructure has been destroyed. Local security assets were extracted in 1969. From a strategic standpoint, every inhabitant of VENUS is now considered a person of threat and should be dealt with accordingly.”

A silence follows.

> “Full reclamation is unlikely. We assess long-term asset loss as permanent.”  
> *(The reckorder’s projection subtly distorts, as if infected by the very chaos **VENUS** represents.)*

---

> **SLIDE 3 – EARTH**  
> *(Visual: grayscale Earth turning slowly; “DECOMMISSIONED” stamped across its surface, timeline overlay of mass migration off-planet)*
>
> “**EARTH**: There is little to address,” William continues, unmoved.  
> “Earth is no longer a recognized operating territory.”

Green shifts, then stills. No one else speaks.

---

> **SLIDE 4 – MARS**  
> *(Visual: red dunes swallowing machines, strange static glyphs appearing momentarily; status reads: “UNEXPLAINED FAILURE”)*
>
> “**MARS:** Despite its status as our first colonization candidate, every initiative has ended in unexplained failure. It remains unoccupied, and likely will remain so.”

The reckorder emphasizes a flashing red buffer zone around the planet’s orbit.

> “Fortunately, its remoteness and symbolic importance to the insurgents acts as a natural barrier to ideological contagion.”

Jones and Michael exchange quiet nods, scribbling notes down.

---

> **SLIDE 5 – JUPITER**  
> *(Visual: R&D moons in orbit; data streams showing green operational metrics; Callisto marked “under surveillance”)*
>
> “**JUPITER**: Our R&D satellites—Io, Europa, and Ganymede—remain stable and ideologically neutral. We intend to increase funding to maintain their strategic output.”

He nods toward the red-pulsing marker on Callisto.

> “Minor disturbances have been reported, but remain manageable.”

---

> **SLIDE 6 – SATURN**  
> *(Visual: glowing ring cities with stained-glass hues; fine-print contracts scroll in the corner; stat: “204,239 Faith Centers”)*
>
> “**SATURN**: Since our departure from Earth, **SATURN** has served as a nexus for spiritual and cultural continuity.”

Lamont, **SATURN**’s representative, gives a brief nod of approval.

> “The settlements are autonomous and doctrinally rigid. Our presence is limited, bound by longstanding contract. Intervention is neither advised nor welcomed.”

---

> **SLIDE 7 – URANUS**  
> *(Visual: The Pillar stretching from the middle of the planet vertically in both directions; silhouettes labeled “TARGET – EXECUTE”)*
>
> “**URANUS:** Our central defense and contractor training site. The Pillar spans from planetary core to upper atmosphere and lower atmosphere.”

The reckorder highlights internal maps of training regimens and punishment queues.

> “Execution protocols are in place for any confirmed sympathizer of Venusian ideology. With proper oversight, further action will be minimal.”

Kildare, ex-military, remains stone-faced.

---

> **SLIDE 8 – NEPTUNE**  
> *(Visual: sprawling underground nerve-map; above, the luminous Synchronity Complex pulses with datafeeds; alert flashes: “IF **NEPTUNE** FALLS, WE ALL FALL”)*
>
> “**NEPTUNE:** Our administrative capital. Beneath the surface lies a vast bureaucratic nerve center—synchronization at full capacity.”

The reckorder zooms in on interlinking tunnel paths and encrypted communication feeds, painting a network of control.

> “Above, the Synchronity Complex coordinates planetary oversight. This is our forward base. If **NEPTUNE** falls,” he pauses, letting the final slide pulse,  
> “we all fall.”

A standing ovation erupts, echoing through the grand chamber. The reckorder slowly fades to black, leaving only the emblem of the **7-P Committee** hovering midair like a watchful eye.
