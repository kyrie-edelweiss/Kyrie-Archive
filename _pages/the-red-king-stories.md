# Period: Present Day … Year: 1988 … Location: URANUS

A man in his forties stands in front of his reckoner box. He tries to select the Broadcast Channel but is quickly interrupted by a damn-near one minute advertisement.

> *When people think of **VENUS**, they think of acid, black lungs, and sex cultists…*
> *Think again.*
> 
> *The Blood Ocean Phenomenon has entirely revitalized the shamed little sister of our System.*
> 
> *But how did we get here? Well, it all started with pioneer Sarah "Sam" Ackermann, who invented Azbestite.*
> 
> *Azbestite, yes, of all things, started out in her cramped garage on the lost province of Germany, Earth. Come this breakthrough, colonization efforts were revolutionized.*
> 
> _**VENUS** was conquered. The mines labored. The factories churned._
> 
> *Most importantly, the phosphorus supply was steady.*
> 
> *Everything was seemingly fine.*
> 
> *Then we lost all contact.*
> 
> *Not anymore.*
> 
> *Come see the blood.*
> 
> *Come see the red.*
> 
> *Wash away your sins.*

He closes the hourly scheduled advertisement and swiftly rushes to the so-familliar Broadcast Channel rectangle.

> *"…THE PERPRETATOR WAS CONVICTED ON SUSPICION OF VENUSIAN IDEALS AND ARRESTED BEFORE INCIDENT…"*
> 
> . . .
> 
> *"THIS JUST IN… THE 7-P COMMITTEE CONFIRMED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MYSTERIOUS DEBRIS ABOVE **VENUS**…"*
> 
> . . .
> 
> *"EVEN MORE WORRYING IS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF YET ANOTHER CELESTIAL BODY…"*
> 
> . . .
> 
> *"POLITICIANS SYSTEM-WIDE ENCOURAGE PROMPT RE-COLONIZATION OF **VENUS**…"*
> 
> . . .
> 
> *"A NATIONWIDE SERMON WILL COMMEMORATE THE LIVES LOST ON **SATURN**…"*
> 
> . . .
> 
> *"MORE RADICAL SEX SUPREMACY PROTE-"*

Another man, in his thirties, drags the Asset Protection captain by the collar and gives him a stern lecture.

"Turn that shit off, Jack. You know watching the Broadcast Channel isn't good for your health. She left you for a reason. Get a grip", he remarks.

"Heard the news? **VENUS** is back on the menu, baby!"

"Tomorrow we're on guard duty for some civillian marks and their hovercycle – said they wanted to see the blood oceans for themselves", the lieutenant says while staring at his clipboard.

He scoffs – "7-P's calling it a tourist resort. I call it total lunacy."
