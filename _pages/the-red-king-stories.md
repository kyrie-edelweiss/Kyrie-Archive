## Period: Present Day … Year: 1988 … Location: URANUS

A utilitarian breakroom, dimly lit and acoustically sterile, rests on the 437th sublevel of **The Pillar**, the vast vertical military-industrial complex of **URANUS**. The walls are matte, synthetic steel. The air is stale, processed, and pressurized for endurance rather than comfort. A man sits in half-silence—security contractor by trade, conditioned for both frontline chaos and bureaucratic inertia.

One of them, a grizzled captain in his forties with a receding hairline and acid-pocked skin, activates the embedded reckoner interface beside the meal dispenser.

He selects **Broadcast Channel**.

Immediately, a full-screen advertisement takes hold of the room, projecting across the far wall in vibrant, overstimulated color. A voice begins.

> *"When people think of **VENUS**, they think of acid, black lungs, and sex cultists..."*

The captain exhales sharply through his nose. He’s heard this pitch before.

> *"Think again."*

Sweeping vistas of scarlet oceans and sleek, white corporate domes flow across the wall. The projector adapts hue levels dynamically, bathing the room in soft red light.

> *"The **Blood Ocean Phenomenon** has entirely revitalized the shamed little sister of our System."*

> *"But how did we get here? Well, it all started with pioneer Sarah 'Sam' Ackermann, who invented **Azbestite**."*

Black-and-white footage shows a wiry woman welding inside a cluttered garage. The Earth flag behind her sags in an acid-warped frame.

> *"Azbestite, yes, of all things, started out in her cramped garage on the lost province of Germany, Earth. Come this breakthrough, colonization efforts were revolutionized."*

> _**VENUS** was conquered. The mines labored. The factories churned._

> *"Most importantly, the phosphorus supply was steady."*

> *"Everything was seemingly fine."*

The footage becomes erratic, grainy. Colors invert. Audio drops for three beats.

> *"Then we lost all contact."*

> *"Not anymore."*

The screen floods red.

> *"Come see the blood. Come see the red. Wash away your sins."*

The advertisement fades. For a half-second, the room dims. Then, the **Broadcast Channel** resumes seamlessly.

> *"...THE PERPETRATOR WAS CONVICTED ON SUSPICION OF VENUSIAN IDEALS AND ARRESTED BEFORE INCIDENT..."*

> *"...THE 7-P COMMITTEE CONFIRMED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MYSTERIOUS DEBRIS ABOVE **VENUS**..."*

> *"...EVEN MORE WORRYING IS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF YET ANOTHER CELESTIAL BODY..."*

> *"...POLITICIANS SYSTEM-WIDE ENCOURAGE PROMPT RE-COLONIZATION OF **VENUS**..."*

> *"...A NATIONWIDE SERMON WILL COMMEMORATE THE LIVES LOST ON **SATURN**..."*

> *"...MORE RADICAL SEX SUPREMACY PROTE—"*

The channel stutters. The sound collapses into garbled feedback.

Footsteps approach.

A second man enters—late thirties, clean-cut, clipboard underarm. Lieutenant Anthony. He strides across the room and forcibly presses a sequence on the reckoner’s physical panel, terminating the broadcast.

“Turn that shit off, Jack. You know watching the Broadcast Channel isn’t good for your health,” Aames remarks, not unkindly, but with the edge of authority.

The captain rubs his temples. He doesn’t argue. Just mutters.

“She left me for a reason.”

Anthony raises an eyebrow, then tosses a hydration pack toward Jack’s lap.

“Anyway,” he says, scrolling through his clipboard. “Tomorrow we’re on guard duty for some civillian marks and their hovercycle. Said they wanted to see the blood oceans for themselves.”

Jack lets out a single, sharp exhale. A laugh, or maybe a bark.

“**VENUS** is back on the menu, huh?”

Anthony nods once.

“7-P's calling it a tourist resort.”

Jack leans back in his chair. The overhead light flickers once, reacting to power redistribution from the main shaft.

“I call it total lunacy.”

They sit for a moment in silence. Somewhere above them, a deep mechanical hum pulses—The Pillar, alive and always listening.

The reckoner, long thought shut off, flickers once more. A final message pulses across the wall, projected in muted crimson:

> _“WELCOME BACK TO **VENUS**, CAPTAIN.”_

Neither man acknowledges it.
