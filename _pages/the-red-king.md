# Chapter One - The Severed Womb
**Period: 15 Years Ago … Year: 1969 … Location: VENUS**  

_**BDYRECK-FOOTAGE – VAP 06-011 – 03-01-1969**_

_**AUDIO… ACTIVE**_

The static hums, low and steady, vibrating with tension, like an old machine working itself into oblivion. Beneath the noise, there is something darker—a muffled rhythm of breathing, ragged and desperate. The cries of men, distorted and broken, fill the silence between mechanical growls. Their voices are not sharp—more like the gasps of drowning creatures, their calls twisted into something far less human.

**YOUNG WOMAN** (panting, weeping, laughing):  
"Fuck—fuck, fuck—I can feel it—I'm so close, I'm so close!"

**MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN** (fevered, chanting):  
_"Hold him still! Hold him still! Keep his head like that!"_

_**VIDEO… ACTIVE**_

The grainy feed flickers, revealing a room ravaged by time. The walls are cracked, peeling like old skin, the air thick with the smell of decay. The floor is littered with scraps, remnants of something long dead. The light is weak, seeping in through narrow slats, casting a sickly glow that stretches the shadows into grotesque shapes.  

At the center of the room, six women form a circle. Some kneel, some stand, others squat, their postures aggressive, unnatural—like animals closing in on their prey. In the middle, three men are bound to battered chairs, their bodies naked and trembling. The women move around them with ruthless precision, their eyes wild, glazed over with fervor. Every motion is deliberate, but there is no grace—only hunger, a desperation that pushes beyond the bounds of reason.

The men are gagged, bound with thick, soiled linen. They are nothing more than vessels—emptied of their humanity, reduced to objects for the women’s ritual. The air hums with the rhythm of it all: thrusts, screams, cuts, and grunts that blur into one chaotic symphony of violent devotion.

Each stroke, each tear of flesh, each cry from the men is not an act of cruelty—no, it is an offering. Every drop of blood is sacrament. Every scream is a hymn of liberation, a hymn that sings the destruction of everything they have known. The women’s movements are erratic, almost animalistic in their zeal.

_**MOTION… ERROR – EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION**_

**YOUNG WOMAN** (her voice shaken, ecstatic, as though on the brink of madness):  
_"No—no, fuck, this isn’t enough! I need more—it's never enough! More!"_

In the background, an older woman stands alone. Her presence is calm, composed, like the eye of a storm. Her hair is streaked with gray and bound tightly, but her gaze is sharp—calculating. She watches, her eyes filled with the kind of certainty that comes only from true belief.

**OLDER WOMAN** (low, commanding):  
_"Abigail. He is nothing but meat. Tear his cock off. With your teeth."_

**MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN** (weeping, celebratory):  
_"They deserve it—they deserve this! This is what they’ve done to us. This is the only justice we have!"_

The camera lurches suddenly, as though struck by an invisible force. The frame tilts, showing the warped doorframe of the room—scrawled across it, the sigil of Venus, twisted and deformed.

**OLDER WOMAN** (gravelly, reverent):  
_"Cut him. Slice his throat slowly—don’t rush. Like you’re tracing the lines of a book. Let the blood spray on your breasts."_

The brutality escalates, and the women are no longer women—they are instruments of vengeance, instruments of destruction. Their ecstasy is not sexual—it is a release of everything they've held back for so long. For hours, the recording captures them in a feverish ritual of domination, mutilation, and a perverse devotion to their cause.

By the end of it, the men are unrecognizable—husk-like, their bodies desecrated, drained, and laid bare. Their eyes are still open, their mouths hanging wide, as if they were left in a state of perpetual shock.

**YOUNG WOMAN** (giggling, joyous):  
_"Look at this—this one had a camera. Hey, wasn't this one your father, Sarah?"_

A girl named Sarah laughs, tears streaming down her face. The two young women collapse into each other’s arms, their bodies slick with blood, their laughter filled with madness—a final, almost sacred release.

_Their laughter rings through the desolate room like the tolling of a bell._

A figure steps down the staircase from above—a woman with crimson hair. She moves slowly, deliberately, as though the entire world is beneath her. Unlike the others, she is not disrobed and barefoot. Her presence is one of quiet authority, a force of nature moving in calm defiance of the chaos around her.

She steps forward, unflinching in the face of the destruction, and nods to the elder woman, who watches her with something akin to awe.

**OLDER WOMAN** (softly, reverently):  
_"It’s done? You're sure? Absolutely sure it will work?"_

**REDHEAD** (decided):  
_"Yes. The threshold is cracked. Something is coming—something beautiful."_

**REDHEAD** (louder, with growing fervor):  
_"Those SPA bastards—they will kneel. Their cities will fall. Their tongues will rot in their mouths."_

**REDHEAD** (quiet, resolute):  
_"Something stirs beneath the surface."_

# Chapter Two – A Brief Meeting  

**Period: 8 Years Ago … Year: 1976 … Location: NEPTUNE**


*A cohort of twelve high-ranking personnel are positioned equidistantly around a long, mirror-polished conference table within a spacious, meticulously curated executive chamber. At the helm, a commanding figure presides—posture poised, hands interlaced with practiced composure.*


*She wears the standardized gray of the executive tier—anonymizing, sexless—her silver nameplate glinting in the overhead fluorescents like a cautionary blade. She does not smile often, but when she does, it is calculated.*


*With an assertive tone and a calibrated expression, she begins.*


“I will be conducting roll call while my assistant matches names to faces. Our first official session is now underway. Please respond when your name is called,” she announces with firm authority.


*She proceeds without pause.*


“Anderson. Ayden. Bernstein. Cat. D’Agostino. Green — Are you the art specialist? No? Noted... Jones. Kildare. Lamont. Michael. Suarez. Weiss — Oh, you are the art specialist. Zimmer.”


*A brief pause.*


“That's everyone? Excellent. Good morning. I am Avery-Mary Edelweiss, executive director of this board. This is William Hertz, my senior strategic officer. Welcome to the first official Seven Planet Committee meeting.”


_Her words are crisp, her cadence refined by decades of institutional leadership. Her voice carries the affect of someone who has long since learned how to suppress both her accent and her allegiance to anything **but** the company._


“First, allow me to extend formal commendation. Each of you has demonstrated exceptional performance across high-priority sectors including advanced engineering, capital finance, defense logistics, research, and beyond. Your selection was not incidental—your track records have been reviewed, audited, and validated at the highest levels. Let this moment serve as a rare acknowledgment: your contributions are seen. They are appreciated. Well done.”


*A ripple of polite laughter. Applause follows—brief, respectful. She does not join in.*


“When I was elevated to this position,” she says, eyes scanning the room with a cool steadiness, “I was advised to consider it a unique honor. There are few women in these ranks—statistically, next to none before me. I accepted this not as a contradiction, but as a *correction*. Sentiment is not a substitute for strategy.”


*She continues, tone shifting to operational gravity.*


“Due to the insurgent forces that have seized control of our critical asset **VENUS** — as well as their continued acts of violence carried out under the guise of so-called *sex liberation*, this department has been established with a singular mandate: to dismantle the rising tide of female-led radical extremism.”


*A few nods. Some lean forward. Green emits a quiet whistle. Applause, firmer this time.*


“They will not proceed unchecked. We will neutralize their influence and weed out their uprising, starting from the outermost colonies — **NEPTUNE** — and advancing inward across every planetary jurisdiction under our protection,” she states, gesturing emphatically.


*The room breaks into structured applause.*


*She does not smile. She simply nods once—subtle, contained—then signals to her second-in-command.*


“I’ll now hand it over to William, who will provide an overview of the planetary situation. He’s a very smart, capable, and passionate man.”

---

_William Hertz steps forward with measured authority. A low mechanical hum follows as the **reckorder**, embedded into the ceiling panel, activates. The chamber lights dim slightly. A translucent projection materializes on the wall behind him—clean, minimal, and institutional blue._

> **SLIDE 1 – MERCURY**  
> *(Visual: a scorched, wind-blasted colony; heat-map overlay in red; “Threat Vector: Eliminated”)*
“**MERCURY**: Following a sabotage event targeting atmospheric filtration systems, the colony is currently non-viable,” Hertz begins.  
“No recovery operations are scheduled. While regrettable, the loss neutralizes a significant threat vector. Reconstruction efforts will prioritize enhanced security infrastructure.”  
*He pauses. The screen flickers.*  
“A moment of silence, please, for all confirmed *client* casualties.”  
*(The projection dims to a dark gray, displaying a silent counter of names: 841 dead.)*

> **SLIDE 2 –** Venus  
> *(Visual: glitched-out industrial landscape, static interference, silhouettes of women holding rifles are rendered in black, “1966: Total Comms Loss | 1969: Final Withdrawal”)*
“Venus: The situation is critical,” Hertz states, the image casting red light across the conference chamber.  
“This was the epicenter of the servile uprising. The site of the Effort Distribution Complexes. Communications ceased entirely in 1966. All management infrastructure has been destroyed. Local security assets were extracted in 1969. From a strategic standpoint, every inhabitant of Venus is now considered a malfunctioning asset and should be dealt with accordingly.”  
*A silence follows.*  
“Full reclamation is unlikely. We assess long-term asset loss as permanent.”  
*(The reckorder’s projection subtly distorts, as if infected by the very chaos Venus represents.)*


> **SLIDE 3 –** Earth  
> *(Visual: grayscale Earth turning slowly; “DECOMMISSIONED” stamped across its surface, timeline overlay of mass migration off-planet)*
“Earth: There is little to address,” William continues, unmoved.  
“It's no longer a recognized operating territory.”  
*Green shifts, then stills. No one else speaks.*

> **SLIDE 4 – MARS**  
> *(Visual: red dunes swallowing machines, strange static glyphs appearing momentarily; status reads: “UNEXPLAINED FAILURE”)*
“**MARS:** Despite its status as our first colonization candidate, every initiative has ended in unexplained failure. It remains unoccupied, and likely will remain so.”  
*(The reckorder emphasizes a flashing red buffer zone around the planet’s orbit.)*  
“Fortunately, its remoteness and symbolic importance to the insurgents acts as a natural barrier to ideological contagion.”  
*Jones and Michael exchange quiet nods, scribbling notes down.*

> **SLIDE 5 – JUPITER**  
> *(Visual: R&D moons in orbit; data streams showing green operational metrics; Callisto marked “under surveillance”)*
“**JUPITER**: Our R&D satellites—Io, Europa, and Ganymede—remain stable and ideologically neutral. We intend to increase funding to maintain their strategic output.”  
*He nods toward the red-pulsing marker on Callisto.*  
> “Minor disturbances have been reported, but remain manageable.”

> **SLIDE 6 – SATURN**  
> *(Visual: glowing ring cities with stained-glass hues; fine-print contracts scroll in the corner; stat: “204,239 Faith Centers”)*  
“**SATURN**: Since our departure from Earth, **SATURN** has served as a nexus for spiritual and cultural continuity.”  
_Lamont, **SATURN**’s representative, gives a brief nod of approval._  
“The settlements are autonomous and doctrinally rigid. Our presence is limited, bound by longstanding contract. Intervention is neither advised nor welcomed.”  

> **SLIDE 7 – URANUS**  
> *(Visual: The Pillar stretching from the middle of the planet vertically in both directions; silhouettes amid masses of men labeled “TARGET – EXECUTE”)*
“**URANUS:** Our central defense contractor training site. The Pillar spans from planetary core to upper atmosphere and lower atmosphere. This is an exclusively-male sector.”  
*(The reckorder highlights internal maps of training regimens and punishment queues.)*  
“Execution protocols are in place for any suspected sympathizer of Venusian ideology. With proper oversight, further action will be minimal.”  
*Kildare, ex-military, remains stone-faced.*

---

> **SLIDE 8 – NEPTUNE**  
> *(Visual: city-surface, stacked architecture like corporate files, sprawling underground nerve-map; a blinking green dot marks their current position)*
“**NEPTUNE:** Our administrative capital. Beneath the surface lies a vast bureaucratic nerve center—synchronization at full capacity.”  
*(The reckorder zooms in on interlinking tunnel paths and encrypted communication feeds, painting a network of control.)*  
“This is our current position. If **NEPTUNE** falls,” he pauses, letting the final slide pulse,  
“we all fall.”  

_A standing ovation erupts, echoing through the grand chamber. The reckorder slowly fades to black, leaving only the emblem of the **7-P Committee** hovering midair like a watchful eye._

# Chapter Three - Katherina
**Period: Present Day … Year: 1984 … Location: Venus**

There were many dwellers within the expanse of space—some bearing names that rang like chimes through the ancient ether, others nameless, faceless things, whose presence could only be felt in the tremble of matter and thought. These watchers had lingered in the void long before Earth’s first radio wave pulsed outward. They had seen empires rise from dust and fall into ash across the breadth of the stars.

They bore witness, too, when humanity—bleeding, burning, desperate—fled its ruined cradle and scattered itself like pollen into the endless black.

And then there once was a young woman—**Katherina.**

The nights were long now, longer than they had any right to be. Out here, in this forgotten corridor of the cosmos, light was a dying thing. The stars no longer comforted; they glared down like indifferent gods with eyes that had long since turned away. The sky was *blacker than black,* not empty, but *hollow.* 

Her life unfolded in a flickering chamber of pale phosphorus light. The phosphorus would hum incessantly - and when it did go silent, she could almost hear her thoughts echo.

She subsisted on her stale canned food reserve. She read brittle books by the soft white light, old words etched by forgotten hands. Every now and then she allowed herself a small indulgence—her signature mixed tea brewed from what remains of the local herbs, laced with syrup that she rationed like it was blood. The sweetness made her cry sometimes.

And when she could gather the strength, she would drag her body across the frost-rimed landscape or derelict neighborhoods and bunkers, calling out for voices that never answered. Her search stretched across months, across years, across the brittle thread of her sanity.

She grew quieter.

But sometimes, when sleep found her in its gentler moods, Katherina would dream.

She would dream of two women—one young and golden-haired, the other older, her face scarred and her hair red like beetroot. They held her, fed her, whispered words not in any Earthborn tongue. She remembered the smell of oil and incense, the soft scratch of robes, the heat of hands on her forehead.

And when the dreams faded—when she woke to the silence and the metal and the frost—something inside her *broke further.*

One night, when her thoughts became too loud and the darkness too vast, Katherina would step into the lightless deadzone of her abode sheltered from the encroach of the phosphorus-light. Her breath was foggy. She dropped to her knees.

Kneeling, she turned her eyes to the stars—not in reverence, but in desperation. Her voice, hoarse from disuse, cracked as she pleaded to the celestial spheres, to the husks of constellations, to the _absent light of the **SUN**._

There was no answer.

Only silence. The kind that weighs.

And then her thoughts spiral from there:

*"I hope someone visits me soon.*  
*That's what I need.*  
*I won’t be alone anymore.*  
*When they come visit me…*  
*I won’t be so cold.*  
*It’ll be nice.*  
*I can't be alone anymore.*  
*I hope someone visits me soon.*  
*I won't be alone anymore."*

She repeated these words like scripture. Like a mantra carved into her soul by frostbitten fingers.

And time—patient, cruel, unending—marched on.

No voice ever came. No warmth returned. The world she once knew was dust, the people she once loved were myth, and the stars were no longer storytellers, only tombstones.

Her loneliness metastasized into something deeper. Not merely a want for company—but a *hunger* for purpose, for meaning, for **visitation.**

Sometimes, she thought she heard whispers from the sky. Songs from the rust of metal. Footsteps in the radio-static. Sometimes, she welcomed them.

But in the end, for all she ever knew…

…there was no one and nothing left.

Only Katherina.

Stranded in the vast, frigid dead-space—

Ever since the **SUN** departed.

# Chapter Four - The RED KING
**Period: Present Day … Year: 1984 … Location: Venus**

Katherina lay draped across her narrow bed, limbs slack, eyes fluttering beneath pale lids—half-sunken in sleep, half-hungering still. She had devoured another text from the Venusian archive, a brittle book bound in leather-soft skin, its pages soaked in language that shimmered like oil under her flickering phosphorus light. She’d read it cover to cover, mouth parted in trance, and tossed it into the growing pile beside her—*The Liturgies of the Fleshbound Womb*, or something like that.

The air around her pulsed with faint heat. Her mind flickered between dream and waking.

Then, in the corner of her softening sight—*a shadow.*

First upon her thigh. Then sliding upward across her ribs, to her chest, like a hand made not of matter but *pressure.* The room dimmed further, and the breath in her lungs felt thick with iron. The shadow moved—not quickly, not violently—but *deliberately*, with the certainty of something that had been waiting far too long.

The thunder that once rumbled in the high sky fell silent.

Even the low, constant hum of Venus's acidic winds held its breath.

And in the stillness—beyond the glass of her narrow window, past the ragged clouds of sulfur and rain—stood something massive.

It did not blink. It did not move.  
But it *watched.*

**MARS.**  
The **RED KING**.

And Katherina, paralyzed in that dim room, felt her thoughts collapse like ash. Her skin turned to glass. Her blood grew cold. She tried to scream, to call out, but only breath escaped—wet and useless.

Her hand reached for the knife in the bedside drawer—a rusted little thing, barely sharper than a spoon—but even that small act felt impossible beneath that *gaze.*

And then—like thunder cracking across her bones—a voice:

**"LITTLE GIRL."**

It did not echo through the room.

It echoed through Venus.

Through the soil. Through the metal. Through the marrow of her bones.

Katherina shrieked—a sound ragged and primal, torn from the darkest place inside her. The bedframe shook beneath her, groaning like it too feared what had come.

And again, the voice:

**"YOU RUN TOO FAR IN THE DARK…  
AND YOU GET YOURSELF LOST."**

Something changed. The dream peeled back. This was not a vision. This was not fantasy or delusion or fever-born madness. This was *now.* This was *real.*

Her pleading had been answered—not by the star-eyed mothers, not by the Watchers, not by Venus, but by **MARS.**

And he had come in *full.*

The silence thickened. Her chest heaved. The lightbars flickered and dimmed, flickered and died.

And then, softer this time. Like fire warming cold hands:

**"CALM DOWN. I AM WHOLE.  
I CAN MAKE YOU WHOLE."**

Katherina opened her mouth. She did not scream.

She *spoke* to him.

She told him how alone she was. How long she had wandered. How there were no voices left. How she had searched every place, every spot, every echo. How her memories were slipping from her. How she stockpiled rations into boxes and boxes of the stuff. How she no longer remembered the faces of her mothers, or if they had ever loved her, or if they were even real. And how her name is *Katherina*.

She told him how she had waited.

And waited.

And *waited.*

The voice no longer rattled her teeth. The bed no longer trembled.

Something inside her soul — *something frayed and near-broken* — stilled.

And then:

**"WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NAME."**

No one had told her anything like that in so long. Not the stars. Not the transmission beacons she activated every year.

And now here he was.

Something ancient. Something opposite.

But not cruel.

# Chapter Six - Bedtime Stories
**Period: Present Day … Year: 1984 … Location: Venus**

_The phosphorus light trembled like a candle lost in a cavernous lung. Outside, the sulfurous wind hissed its muted lullaby. Inside, the air was **thick**—syrupy with heat and pressure and the scent of something ancient._

Katherina sat upright upon her narrow bed, posture brittle but poised, facing the frost-veined window like it was an altar. Beyond the fogged pane, in that strange depthless black where the stars had once sung, the shape waited. Not hovering. Not looming.

Simply *there*.

**MARS** had no face—but somehow she could feel the weight of his eyes. The curve of attention. His silence was not absence, but *invitation.*

They *spoke*.

For an hour or more—though time had long since become a concept for the desperate—they traded truths like relics. Her voice was coarse, shaped by long disuse and colder nights. His voice, by contrast, was monolithic. Not loud. *Large.* A sound that filled space and bone and the narrowing corridors of her mind.

She told him of her loneliness. Of the dead cities. The old names. The taste of ration-syrup and the tea that made her weep. She told him of her searching, of the bunkers, the towers, the bones she whispered to. Of her mothers—real or imagined—and of the dreams where hands stroked her hair and kissed her third eye.

He listened.

And then, somewhere between a laugh and a confession, Katherina made a sly remark—about the *men* of Venus, or rather, the lack of them. The hollow ones, the cruel ones, the weak ones. She spoke of longing. Of hunger. Of the heat between her thighs that not even prayer could soothe.

**MARS** did not pause. He *declared*:

> **"I AM THE PERFECT MAN. I AM THE CONCEPT OF MAN. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER LIKE ME."**

His words did not warm her. They *pierced* her. Something inside her clenched—not in fear, but in awe. In recognition.

They discussed this—what it meant to *be* a man, a god, a concept made flesh through will and violence and memory. And desire.

Then she asked about the others.

The voices once heard across the stars. The transmissions. The colonies. The laughter and horror of a species that once scattered like pollen into the cosmic wind.

**MARS** responded like scripture:

> **"THE OTHERS ARE GONE. THEY ABANDONED US."**

She reeled. But not because he knew. Because he *didn’t*. He, too, was unsure. They had simply… vanished.

He repeated, quieter this time, but with twice the weight:

> **"IT’S JUST US NOW.  
> IT’S JUST US NOW."**

The echo sank into her ribs. She nodded.

The conversation twisted again—spiraled downward like a bloody offering down a stone drain.

> **"THEY RAVAGED IT,"**
> **"ALL OF IT. THERE’S NOTHING LEFT."**

War. Starfire. Collapse. The death of Venusian cities, the fracturing of mind and memory and myth.

> **"NOT JUST THE HUMANS.  
> THE STARS TOO, IN THEIR OWN WAY."**

> **"THEIR POINTLESS WARS…  
> THERE’S NOTHING LEFT."**

And that was truth.

Not spoken. *Etched.*

> **"WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER.  
> IT’S ALL THEIR FAULT."**

Katherina did not resist this truth. She *absorbed* it. Welcomed it like warmth on a frostbitten palm. Their world—ravaged, starless, orphaned—was still *theirs.*

They spoke further. Of survival. Of purpose. Of becoming more than the echo of a dead race.

And then, **MARS**, with the slow gravity of inevitability, said:

> **"IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY NOW.  
> THIS COLD PLACE IS OUR HOME.  
> WE WILL MAKE IT OUR HOME."**

His voice was not pleading. It was *sovereign.*

She did not hesitate. She understood.

But **MARS** paused—perhaps for the first time—and offered her a way out:

> **"YOU DON’T HAVE TO BURDEN YOURSELF WITH THIS.  
> REMEMBER, YOU CAN BACK OUT ANYTIME."**

Katherina answered without blinking.

> **"I UNDERSTAND."**

A breathless pause followed. The light dimmed further. Outside, the shape in the void seemed to lean *closer.*

And then, softly—like a knife kissing skin:

> **"DO YOU LOVE ME?"**

She blinks.

And something comes back. Not all at once—but like a smell remembered from childhood.

A warm lap.  
Fingers combing through her hair.  
A lullaby hummed off-key.  
The feel of soft cloth draped over her cheek while someone whispered:

*"Shh, little one. You're safe. You're loved. Sleep now."*

There were two voices.  
Two women.  
One spoke with a low, scratchy laugh, like gravel and honey. The other was gentler—young, nervous, always fussing over the blankets. One wore thick gloves from working near acid vents. The other always smelled like tea leaves and salt.

They called her their miracle.  
They made her soup.  
They told her stories about stars.

She remembers lying between them in the dark, the hum of a failing generator overhead, feeling them breathe on either side.

*"You're going to be someone,"* one whispered.  
*"You already are,"* said the other.

But then it changes.

A knock on the metal door.  
A flashlight in her eyes.  
Gloves again—but colder this time. Rougher.  
Voices she didn’t recognize.

*"She’s the one."*  
*"Just sedate her."*

She screamed for her mothers.  
She felt the needle.

And then—

Nothing.

When she gasps back into herself, her hands are curled into fists, pressed to her stomach like she’s trying to hold something in. Her breath hitches.

# Chapter Seven - Red Sex
**Period: Present Day … Year: 1985 … Location: Venus**

The sex was a little awkward.  

She always felt so *small*.

She kept trembling, like she wasn’t built for touch. Like something had broken and regrown inside her crooked.

Katherina sang sometimes, low and off-key. And she danced. Not like a girl, but like a marionette. Tangled strings, twirling just out of reach, her toes skimming ash.

That skinny, skinny frame…

That tired, tired act…

She's uninteresting wearing all that black.

She wore it like she owed it to someone—maybe to the dead, maybe to Venus herself.

I shouldn't, but I peer into her dreams.

She dreams of before the flash. Of a time when Venus and the **SUN** were close—*intimate*. She says they used to kiss through clouds, through fire. She says Venus was radiant once. That she *glowed*. Like I remember Venus.

And she wonders:

> “If they were so close… why did he leave?”  
> “Was it all the noise, the screaming, the endless bickering?”  
> “Was it the sky, stained and bleeding from all the smog?”  
> “Was it the poison-laced oceans and the endless factories?”  
> “Or was it the tears she shed constantly?”  
> “Did her sorrow deform her?”  
> “Would the **SUN** still make love to her disfigured mantle?”  
> “Did VENUS feel lonely, too?”

 And then she spirals from there…

> “Why is **MARS** always up there?”  
> “Why is he so distant?”  
> “Why won’t he come closer?”  
> “Why is he always red with silence?”  
> “If I kissed him, would I start burning, too?”  
> “I’m his little **SUN**. I’m his little **SUN**…”

That's usually when I shut her up.

I don’t want her to see how close I am to burning, too.

# Chapter Eight - Waiting For Black Metal Records To Come In The Mail
**Period: Present Day … Year: 1986 … Location: Venus**

Katherina's life had become a joke at her own expense.

Every morning, **MARS** was turned just a little further away.

Not physically—she could still see him, red and glowering through the acid-streaked clouds—but metaphysically, he felt distant. Like he had retracted something. Like his soul had taken one slow, deliberate step back.

Craters like beauty marks. Mountain ranges like deep scars.

The tin box of mixed teabags was nearly empty. That was her one ritual, her one remaining comfort. The flavors bled together, cheap things imported from **JUPITER**'s moons, stale and scentless. Still, she’d let the bag sit in boiled water for exactly five minutes. Five minutes of control. Five minutes of pretending she had a body that wasn’t falling apart.

She subsisted on sugar cubes and rice. Sometimes honey if she rationed right. The sweetness barely registered. She suspected **MARS** liked her thin. Her hip bones stuck out like warning signs. Her wrists could cut.

All the standard phosphorus lights malfunctioned. Gasoline was low to the point where she moved in pitch black, counting steps.

Keeping herself busy with arts and crafts was growing more and more difficult. Drawing had become shameful. **MARS** didn’t like the way she depicted him-said it was "dishonest." Her karaoke was increasingly uninspired. And the monospeaker—*that* speaker—emitted this faint whine, a mosquito in her ear that never died. It broadcast his voice sometimes, or a distorted imitation of it.

He still enjoyed her dancing. Actually, he loved it. Sensual, slow. She danced even when her legs shook. Even when her lungs burned.

She wasn’t sure when the talking stopped.

They used to talk about strange, beautiful things. Cosmic things. Ideas. Symbols. She’d ask questions, and **MARS** would answer in riddles that felt profound.

The demands came faster. Her mind couldn’t keep up. Sometimes she'd forget her own name.

> *Sex ruins everything that could’ve been beautiful.*

She didn’t remember where she heard that. Or if she said it first. Maybe it was in a dream. Maybe it was a thought Venus once whispered before the **SUN** left her behind.

The worst part was the suspicion. **MARS** had to be hiding something. Behind all the cold lust, behind the obsession—something was *wrong*. She didn’t have the words. She only had a sensation deep in her stomach.

This could not be kept up any longer.

# Chapter Ten - Black Metal Records
**Period: Present Day … Year: 1987 … Location: Venus**

Tonight was silent.  

He wasn’t speaking tonight.  
Not aloud. Not through the crackling wires, not through the walls or the machines.  
**MARS** didn’t need to anymore.  

He preferred the inside of her skull.

His voice burrowed, uninvited, into her thoughts. Sometimes as words. Sometimes just a pressure behind the eyes.
Some nights, he would press into her muscles, inhabit them, wear her bones like clothes.

Walked her across the room.  
Made her smile.  
Made her beg.  
Made her touch herself.

But tonight?  
Stillness.  

Katherina had learned not to *think*.  

Thinking was dangerous.  
A single wrong phrase, a flicker of doubt—  
and he could be inside her again.  

So she went through the motions.  

As she feigned the usual bedtime routine - brisk dip in the lake, drying off her body and touching up her hair, rubbing some of the local vegetation on her teeth…

She slipped up.  

She had it. She had the thought.

And like a hand to the throat—  
He was there.  

No warning. No chance.  

Her skull *split open* with his voice.  

> **SINNER, WRONG DOER, EVIL DOER, WORKER OF INIQUITY, A BAD EXAMPLE, SCOUNDREL, VILLAIN, KNAVE, VIPER, WRETCH, THE DEVIL INCARNATE, MONSTER, DEMON, FALLEN ANGEL, LOST SHEEP, BLACK SHEEP, A LOAFER AND A SNEAK. A GOOD FOR NOTHING FUCKING BITCH AND A WHORE.**

It wasn’t just noise.  
It was *penetration*.  

He entered her thoughts like a blade.  
Slid into the gaps of her memories.  
Flooded every synapse with his filth.  
Took her body from her, again.  

She felt weak. She felt her legs move without consent. She felt sick to her stomach.
Her mouth twitch. Her spine arch.

_"leave me alone. you have my body already, let the rest of me be"_

But he was inside already.  
And she couldn’t scream without him tasting it.

*“leave me alone. leave me alone. please don't do it again, please, i can't do it anymore.”*

Her voice sounded so far away.

_“leave m_**E ALONE.”**

**“LEAVE ME ALONE.”**

**“MY SOUL IS FLAWLESS AND PURE.”**

**“I DISREGARD THE PRECAUTIONS.”**

**“I WANT TO BREAK.”**

And that’s when something would break.
Not inside her.  
*But in the sky.*

**KATHERINA**'s hand rose—unthinking. Instinctual.  
Like Venus herself moved through her veins.  

She struck upward.  

Tore at the heavens with thought turned to weapon.

The sky peeled.  
The stars *shivered*.
Her thoughts ran down, dripped down, became reality.
The curse of the **RED KING**.

And Mars came undone.  

**KATHERINA** pulled him down.  
Ripped him from the black.  
Held him—smaller than ever—in her hand.  

And then—  
**the flash.**

Blinding.
Yellow.
Revealed.

And there it was — what Mars hid all this time. The truth she was *raped* away from knowing.

> The **SUN**.  
> Still shining. Still burning.  
> Hidden behind Mars.  

He had hidden the dawn.  

He stole the light,  
stole the warmth,  
stole *the life itself*—  

—from **KATHERINA**.  
—from *Venus*.  
—from *everyone*.  

Mars had done it.

He had silenced the world in shadow and called it "love."

> Mars wasn’t love.  
> He was *control*.  
> He was the night.  
> He was the nightmare.  
> The thing that whispers _“you’ll never be free.”_ 

But **KATHERINA** had ripped him out.  

Mars was responsible.

Mars would be sorry.

Mars was the night, the nightmare.

# Chapter Eleven - Curse of the RED KING
**Period: Present Day … Year: 1987 … Location: Venus**

_(Above the churning yellow clouds of Venus, **KATHERINA** levitates. In her cupped palms, she holds Mars—small, dim, stripped of dominion. Her jaw is clenched. Her eyes burn. She's fuming with anger, boiling, stewing… frothing. And yet her mouth won't open.)_

*Mars* (begging):
Don't do this.  
Put me back, please.  
I thought you loved me.

_**KATHERINA**_ (voice booming across the night sky):  
**I THOUGHT I LOVED YOU. BUT YOU WERE JUST ALL I HAD. YOU MADE SURE YOU WERE ALL I HAD.**

*Mars* (softly):  
That’s not true, **KATHERINA**.  
You were all *I* had too.  
Celestial bodies were never meant to touch the human world.  
But I broke the rules. For you.  
I just wanted to feel.  
To know what it was like.

_**KATHERINA**_ (seething):  
**SEE WHAT? TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO USE SOMEONE LIKE A FLESH SOCK?**

*Mars*:  
It wasn’t supposed to go like that.  
You taught me what pleasure meant.  
I didn’t know what it was to *want* before you.  
And then… I couldn’t stop.  
I was cursed with hunger.  
And you—  
You were so warm.  
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, **KATHERINA**.

_(Silence. She doesn’t answer. He shifts in her palms.)_

*Mars*:  
We can fix this.  
We’ve both changed.  
Let’s start again.  
This time… you say my name first.

_**KATHERINA**_:  
**"NO. I REFUSE. I CAN'T LET YOU TAKE CONTROL AGAIN."**

*Mars* (gently):  
Oh, dear. Control?  
You’ve grown so much.  
There's no point in controlling you anymore.  
And I’ve always watched you from afar.  
Even when you thought you were alone.  
I know you - I always kept an eye out for you.
Because you were special…  

_(Her face flickers—contempt, grief, longing. She begins to tremble.)_

*Mars* (whispering):  
Aren’t you…  
my little **SUN**?

_(Her scream splits the upper atmosphere. Then, beneath the scream—sobs. Raw. Childlike. Her hands loosen.)_

*Mars* (soothing):  
Shh… calm, calm now.  
You want to know, don’t you?  
The truth. About your parents. Your origin.  
Who you really are?

_(She hesitates. Then a quiet answer.)_

_**KATHERINA**_:  
**"I… I DO. I DO WANT TO KNOW."**

*Mars*:  
You were born of two Venusian mothers.  
You lived in a cozy little commune under the earth, away from any exterior inferrence.  
They loved you more than anything in this world.  
They would’ve kept you, protected you, worshipped you.  

But the Seven Planet Authority—the human government of the system— found you.  
They ripped you from their arms.  
Raised you underground in bunkers.  
Malnourished you. Hurt you.  
Called you names—  
_Bad omen. Chimera. Icon of the coming revolution._

When you came of age, they injected you.  
White, liquid forgetfulness.  
You forgot everything.  
And when they were done with you—  
They threw you out.  
They shot everyone else.  
Left you to wander.

That’s your story, **KATHERINA**.  
Isn’t that what you wanted?

_(She convulses. Rage and disbelief churn in her gut. She grips Mars tighter.)_

_**KATHERINA**_:  
**"THAT CAN'T BE… IT'S LIES… YOU'RE LYING AGAIN…"**

*Mars* (gasping):  
Stop—please—you’re hurting me!

_(Reflex. Her grip loosens.)_

*Mars*:  
I was trying to protect you…  
From the bitter truth and all the pain that comes with it.  
I love you, **KATHERINA**.  
We can begin again.  
Do you trust me?

_(A pause. Her mind sways like a candle in vacuum.)_

_**KATHERINA**_ (quiet):  
**"I TRUST YOU."**

*Mars*:  
Say my name.

_**KATHERINA**_:_  
**"MARS… I—"**

_(The moment the name passes her lips, the spell snaps.)_

_Katherina:_  
—NO—

_(But it’s too late. She drops. Her body plummets, limp, through the sulfurous skies. Falling—not in love, but back to earth. Into ruin.)_

_**MARS**_ (ascending, regaining form):  
**I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.**

_(He catches her gently. Her skin pales. Her hair drains of color. Her eyes go hollow. Her essence returns to Venus—the place of her making, and of her unmaking.)_

_**MARS**_ (stroking her hair):  
**MY LITTLE SUN.** 
**I NEVER MEANT FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.** 
**I JUST…**
**I CAN'T BELIEVE I ALLLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN.**

_(He lowers her down—into the dirt.)_

_**MARS**_ (whispering):  
**"VENUS IS DEAD."**  
**"I NAME YOU VENUS."**  
**"LONG LIVE VENUS."**

_(And **VENUS** would be once more.)_

# Chapter Twelve - Stories
**Period: Present Day … Year: 1988 … Location: URANUS**

A utilitarian breakroom, dimly lit and acoustically sterile, rests on the 437th sublevel of **The Pillar**, the vast vertical military-industrial complex of **URANUS**. The walls are matte, synthetic steel. The air is stale, processed, and pressurized for endurance rather than comfort.

A grizzled captain in his sixties with a receding hairline and acid-pocked skin, activates the embedded reckoner interface beside the meal dispenser.

He selects **Broadcast Channel**.

Immediately, a full-screen advertisement takes hold of the room, projecting across the far wall in vibrant, overstimulated color. A voice begins.

---

> *"When people think of **VENUS**, they think of acid, black lungs, and sex cultists..."*

The captain exhales sharply through his nose. He’s heard this pitch before.

> *"Think again."*

Sweeping vistas of scarlet oceans and sleek, white corporate domes unfurl across the curved wall. The projector adjusts dynamically, painting the briefing room in gentle, systemic red.

> *"The **Blood Ocean Phenomenon** has entirely revitalized the shamed little sister of our System."*

> _"Gone are the days of chaos in the pressure-mines, the hormonal sabotage, the unwashed rites of radical femininity. We have **turned the tide.**"_

Visuals shift. Dramatic flyovers of steaming crater lakes. Corporate flags planted on rockslides.

> _"The **Sunless Commune**, once the heart of Venusian sedition, is no more."_

> *"Over ten thousand insurgents neutralized. Six-thousand two-hundred forty-eight kilometers of tunnel system collapsed. No survivors confirmed."*

A pause. The light flickers red, as if responding to blood pressure.

> *"And with the reclamation of this key site, we are proud to say..."*

> *"...**VENUS is open again.**"*

Footage of hotels beside sterilized craters. Men in suits clink glasses near phosphorescent waterfalls. A servile girl in background focus wipes her nose, then disappears in the edit.

> *"The revolution is over. The communards are gone. The caves are clear."*

> *"Come see the blood. Come see the red. Wash away your sins."*

The ad cuts with precision. One frame lingers too long—an aerial view of scorched rock spelling out **WE REMEMBER** in earthen scars before the screen whites out.

Then, the Broadcast Channel resumes. Music plays. The message is gone.

---

**[ANCHOR – GENDERLESS, MODULATED VOICE, BLINKING AT REGULAR INTERVALS]**

> *“Good evening. This is SPA Broadcast Channel. Your only source for uninterrupted, validated, and sanitized planetary information.”*

---

> *“Our lead story: The individual responsible for the **Dockyard-7 Mass Interruption** has been formally **convicted on suspicion of Venusian ideals** and arrested **two days prior to the incident itself**. Officials stress this is a precautionary success, not a timeline irregularity.”*

> *“The individual’s name will not be released to prevent sympathetic contamination.”*

---

> *“In celestial news: the planet **MARS** has not appeared in any known orbital registry since this morning’s report. Observatories on **JUPITER** confirm the body’s absence. SPA officials say it is ‘probably a clerical abstraction’ and **urge calm.**”*

> *“The Seven Planet Authority reminds citizens: the **perception of loss does not constitute loss**.”*

---

> *“On economic fronts, a **System-wide reinvestment campaign** has been initiated to encourage **prompt and enthusiastic re-colonization of Venus.**”*

> *“SPA Compliance & Wellness notes a sharp rise in fertility compatibility among Venus-adjacent zones.  

---

> *“In memorial: A **nationwide sermon** will air at midnight to commemorate **those lost on SATURN**.”*

> *“Residents in Ring Cities 2 through 5 are advised to remain home during broadcast transmission for optimal reflection.”*

---

> *“In culture: the **Artemisia Reclamation Protest**, initially permitted as an art installation, has been reclassified as a **radical sex supremacy demonstration.** Protesters will be processed under the Gender Compliance Act.”*

> *“Seventeen were arrested. Four were pregnant.  
**None were in violation.**”*

---

> *“And finally: The Neptune Light Index has returned to expected ambient levels after last week’s unusual surge in red-spectrum photonic activity. Reports of disembodied whispering were confirmed to be a **systemized sound glitch**, attributed to overheating in Ministry-approved headpieces.”*

> *“All systems remain green.”*

---

> *“This has been the SPA Broadcast Channel. Obedience is harmony.”*

**[END TRANSMISSION]**

---

The channel stutters. The sound collapses into garbled feedback.

Footsteps approach.

A second man enters—late thirties, clean-cut, clipboard underarm. Lieutenant Anthony. He strides across the room and forcibly presses a sequence on the reckoner’s physical panel, terminating the broadcast.

“Turn that shit off, Jack. You know watching the Broadcast Channel isn’t good for your health,” Anthony remarks, not unkindly, but with the edge of authority.

The captain rubs his temples. He doesn’t argue. Just mutters.

“She left me for a reason.”

Anthony raises an eyebrow, then tosses a hydration pack toward Jack’s lap.

“Anyway,” he says, scrolling through his clipboard. “Tomorrow we’re on guard duty for some civillian marks and their hovercycle. Said they wanted to see the blood oceans for themselves.”

Jack lets out a single, sharp exhale. A laugh, or maybe a bark.

“**VENUS** is back on the menu, huh?”

Anthony nods once.

“The SPA is calling it a tourist resort.”

Jack leans back in his chair. The overhead light flickers once, reacting to power redistribution from the main shaft.

“I call it total lunacy.”

They sit for a moment in silence. Somewhere above them, a deep mechanical hum pulses—The Pillar, alive and always listening.

The reckoner, long thought shut off, flickers once more. A final message pulses across the wall, projected in muted crimson:

> _“WELCOME BACK TO **VENUS**, CAPTAIN.”_

Neither man acknowledges it.

*(Footsteps in dust. Wind blows faintly. Cam shakes as boots crunch over cracked cement. All three officers are on approach: weapons slung low, helmets off. The motel looms ahead—tall, crooked, bleeding rust.)*

There she is.  
The pride of the pre-revolution tourism industry. Fuckin’ two stars, maybe.

**TANGO**:

(The camera pans over the building—two floors visible, but the silhouette is wrong. Windows are either boarded or melted inward.)

**ZETA (reading tablet)**:  
Registry lists it as decommissioned twenty years ago.
Signal pings from two missing contractors came from inside, though.

(ZETA walks closer, eyes scanning the entry.)

**TANGO (squinting)**:  
Hold up. You see that?

(Tango points forward. The door is slightly ajar, but warped inward at the hinge, like something forced its way out.)

**ZETA**:  
Structural integrity’s shot. Keep eyes on me. Helmets on.

**MIKE (quietly)**:
Why’s the door already open?

**TANGO**:  
They knew we were coming.

(Beat. Silence. Wind shifts.)

**ZETA**:  
Weapons check. We breach on my mark.

*(Zeta straps his boots tighter.)*

**MIKE**:  
You ever get the feeling someone's watching you?

**TANGO**:  
No.

*(Pause.)*

**TANGO (softer)**:  
But I do now.

## [BDYRECK – VAP 33-102 – ENTRY PHASE]

**Time Stamp:** 12:45:01  
**Location:** Interior – Vitruvian Motel, Reception Level

*(Door hinges creak. The metal doesn’t resist—it swings inward with the slow exhale of a deep breath. The interior is darker than expected. The camera auto-corrects exposure. The air immediately registers several degrees warmer.)*

**ZETA (flat)**:  
VAP 33-102. Entry point breached.  
Natural light waning. Flashlights on.

*(Flashlights snap on with soft mechanical clicks. The beams sweep across a trashed lobby. Furniture is overturned, decomposing. A reception desk sags in on itself. Wallpaper is peeling in wide, vertical strips. Godrays through the boarded windows.)*

**MIKE**:  
Okay… this is worse than I expected.

**TANGO**:  
You expected better?

**MIKE (gesturing)**:  
I mean look at it. That used to be a couch. Now it’s mulch.

**ZETA**:  
Focus. Signs of habitation—anything recent?

*(TANGO moves toward the desk. His cam picks up a broken landline, stained not with dust, but with something *damp*. There are no footprints on the floor, just odd drag patterns. Something was moved. Or pulled.)*

**TANGO**:  
This place smells like old copper and vinegar.

**MIKE:**:  
I can hear the ocean.

**ZETA (snaps)**:  
There’s no ocean nearby.  
Block that noise out. Stay sharp.

**TANGO (low)**:  
He’s not wrong. It’s faint... but it’s there. Rolling tide. Coming from above us?

*(Silence falls. The only sound is distant, rhythmic. Not wind. Not pipes. Not footsteps. But a low **pulling sound**, as if something massive were breathing through layers of walls.)*

---

**ZETA**:  
Reception’s clear.

**TANGO**:
Split and sweep the side halls. Call out what you find.

*(The squad moves. Zeta veers right. Mike takes left. Tango holds centerline. Their lights cut through air thick with invisible moisture. Each beam reveals *no mirrors.* Even where frame outlines remain on the wall—nothing reflective. Nothing watching back.)*

---

**MIKE (softly, to himself)**:  
Why seal off the whole place?

**MIKE**:  
I’ve got two doors—both locked. This hallway’s a dead end.

**TANGO**:  
Same. One partially open. No sound. Doesn’t look disturbed.

**ZETA**:  
Lobby level is clear. Proceeding to stairwell.

---

*(Zeta moves ahead. The camera catches one final shot of the lobby—just before they pass into the stairwell: the corner of a painting. Water-damaged, streaked in red. The image is smeared, but some of it remains visible. A **man**. Kneeling. Arms raised. Eyes gone. The title plate beneath it is unreadable.)*

**TANGO (staring)**:  
You seeing this?

**ZETA**:  
Ignore it.

**MIKE**:  
What the hell kind of motel hangs that in the lobby?

*(No response. They move toward the stairwell. The sound of the ocean fades—not disappearing, but **receding**. Like it's waiting for them on another floor.)*

---

## [BDYRECK – VAP 33-102 – STAIRWELL ASCENT]
**Time Stamp:** 12:51:18  
**Location:** Vitruvian Motel – Central Stairwell

*(Heavy door creaks open. Flashlights cut through dust-laced dark. The stairwell is narrow, ribbed with old pipes and condensation. The walls sweat. Paint bubbles in long, oozing strips.)*

**ZETA**:  
Stairwell entry confirmed.

**MIKE (quiet)**:  
You smell that? It’s different in here.

**TANGO:**:  
Yeah. Like boiled metal and damp cloth.  
Same as morgues back on **SATURN.**

---

*(They begin climbing. The steps are slick in places—worn through concrete, not metal. One groans under Mike’s weight. Flashlights wobble on the walls—revealing stains that look like old boot scuffs. Or claw marks. It’s hard to tell.)*

**ZETA**:  
Count your steps.

**TANGO**:  
Why?

**ZETA**:  
If you feel like we’ve gone farther than we should have, I want numbers to prove it.

**MIKE (after a beat)**:  
Thirteen... fourteen... fifteen... wait—

**TANGO**:  
We passed the second floor already.

**MIKE**:  
There wasn’t a door.

---

*(They stop. The landing is blank. No signage. No hallway access. Just more stairs. The lighting fades to a dull, wet amber. A subtle hum now permeates the air—a low vibration, like the sound of an engine.)*

**TANGO**:  
You feel that?

**ZETA**:  
I feel it.

**TANGO**:  
Like someone's watching us climb.

---

*(The next landing finally appears—barely different from the last. No signage. Just a wall where a hallway should be. A single light buzzes overhead, dimming every time someone passes beneath.)*

**ZETA**:  
Altitude indicator says we’ve climbed 8 meters. That’s three floors’ worth.

**MIKE**:  
We’ve only seen **one** floor.

**TANGO**:  
So where are the others?

*(Pause.)*

---

**TANGO**:  
We’re continuing. No backtracking.

**ZETA**:  
This place doesn’t have floors—it has **layers**.

**MIKE**:  
Yeah? What kind of layers?

**TANGO (grim, somewhat sarcastic)**:  
Infernal.

---

*(They pass another landing. The stairwell curves sharper now, like the building’s coiling around them. Shadows deepen. Light sources dwindle. The handrails are damp to the touch—slightly sticky.)*

**MIKE (uneasy)**:  
How many more?

**ZETA**:  
Until we find them.

**TANGO**:  
Or they find us.

---

_(They reach a landing with a partially open door. No markings. Just heat spilling from within.  
A hum behind the walls. The sound of **tide**. Not imagined. Not distant.)_

---

**ZETA (quiet)**:  
We’re here.

**MIKE**:  
This isn’t Floor 2, is it?

**TANGO**:  
No.  
This is **Floor 6**.

---

## [BDYRECK – VAP 33-102 – FLOOR 6 HALLWAY]
**Time Stamp:** 13:22:22  
**Location:** Vitruvian Motel – Floor 6, East Wing  
**Status:** Active Sweep

*(The door creaks as Zeta opens it. The hallway beyond is long, unlit. Their flashlights cut into amber haze. The corridor has no windows, no signs, and no visible end at first. Only silence.)*

**ZETA**:  
Floor 6 confirmed. Proceeding east.  
Eyes sharp. Weapons tight.

**MIKE (low)**:  
Where the hell is my flashlight?

---

*(They step in. The hallway is too wide for a building this size. The walls are slightly bowed—curved inward like ribs. Floor tiles are damp. Stained.)*

**ZETA (scanning)**:  
Four doors. Two left. Two right.  
One at the end.

*(They pause. All the doors are unmarked. Frames are warped—some bloated with moisture, others thinned like something pushed hard against them for years.)*

**TANGO (noting quietly)**:  
You see this?

*(Tango gestures to the floor. Track marks. Scattered. Sharp turns. A pattern of dragging and circular pacing—no shoes.)*

**MIKE**:  
It’s like someone walked in circles… again and again.

**ZETA**:  
We focus on the end door. Sweep and extract.

---

*(They pass the side doors. No doorknobs. Just sealed seams in rusted frames. Zeta’s light catches something on one of the walls—an old mark. Scratched deep. A spiral. Repeated over itself until the wall gave way beneath the pressure.)*

**ZETA**:  
Spiral sigil. Venusian origin. Ritual-grade.  
Somebody carved this with intention.

**MIKE**:  
This was never just a motel.

---

*(A hum increases as they approach the far door. It’s larger than the others. It doesn’t fit the frame. Looks newer—but not cleaner. Like something rebuilt it *from the inside*.)*

**ZETA**:  
Something was pushing from inside. It's been sealed off. Nothing in, or out.

**TANGO**:  
Stack up.

**MIKE**:  
Tango—

**TANGO**:  
We breach it. Now.

*(They position themselves around the door—standard breach posture. The camera shakes slightly from Tango’s pulse. The wall next to the door is moist to the touch.)*

**MIKE**:  
I've got a bad feeling, boss.

**ZETA**:  
You’re not alone.

---

*(The humming stops.  
Complete silence.  
For just a second—so complete it feels like cascading pressure.  
Then—)*

**TANGO (cold)**:  
—KICK IT OPEN!

Tango—approach slow. Restraints first.

### **FRAME 0017**  
**[Visual]**: TANGO steps closer. Camera jitter increases.  
Flashlight catches damp surface on bed. Looks like sweat or condensation.

You’re safe. You’re safe. It’s over.

### **FRAME 0020–0022**  

**[Audio]**: Low rumble. Not from her.
Subject still screaming. Head turns slightly toward TANGO.

**[ZETA]:**  
Get her loose. We’re pulling out.

**[MIKE]:**  
These cuffs are... they’re not metal. They’re *grown in.* I can’t—

## 14:00:11 – EXTRACTION BEGINS
**Time Stamp:** 13:29:22  
**Location:** Vitruvian Motel – Floor 6, East Wing
**Status:** In Progress

*(Boots on tile. Harsh breathing. The girl is silent now, being carried between Tango and Zeta. Mike leads, weapon drawn. Lights dim.)*

**MIKE**:  
We’re clear. Let’s move. Fast.

**TANGO**:  
Got her. Her legs aren’t responding—like she’s… disconnected.

**ZETA**:  
Focus on the extraction. Don't talk out of place.

*(They reach the stairwell. Mike leads the way, more hardened now. He swings the door open. For a moment, there’s only darkness.)*

**MIKE (hesitating)**:  
...Wait. We didn’t climb this many floors.

**TANGO (whispers)**:  
No... we only came up two.

*(They begin descending. Floor by floor. The numbers etched into the concrete are scratched, smeared, distorted—as if the building is trying to forget its own structure.)*

### 14:02:18 – FLOOR -1

*(Lights flicker out. Emergency strips glow faint red. The girl makes a sound—not a scream, but a breath like something surfacing from sleep.)**

**MIKE**  
This isn’t real.  
I—I counted. Two floors up.  
We never climbed this far.

**ZETA**  
You think too much. Just walk.

**TANGO**  
These floors weren’t here on the way in.

### 14:12:03 – FLOOR -3

*(The walls feel closer. The steps narrower. Each floor passed has no doors—just blank landings, like hollow vertebrae.)*

**MIKE**  
I can’t tell if we’re descending… or being led.

**TANGO (to the girl)**  
Can you hear me? Can you move?

*(She doesn’t respond. But her eyes blink. And she smiles absent-mindedly.)*

### 14:38:27 – FLOOR -6

**ZETA**  
We're almost there. Stay sharp.

**TANGO (quiet)**  
No one asked where “there” was.

*(The girl lifts her head. Looks directly at Mike. Her lips move, soundless. Nothing comes out of her. All of them notice, but each one of them keeps it to himself.)*

### 14:44:15 – FLOOR -8

(In the middle, a hatch. Square, steel and rusted. SPA-issue emergency escape hatch. Stamped into its surface:)

> “WELCOME BACK TO **VENUS**, CAPTAIN.”

**MIKE**  
This wasn’t here before.

**TANGO**  
None of this was.

**ZETA**  
Hatch should lead to safety. Open it.

*(MIKE pulls the latch. It gives with a groan. Air rushes through—hot, dry, metallic.)*  
*The outside is grounded with concrete. No reception. No motel.*  
*They step out. The motel vanishes behind them.*  
*All that's left is the four of them - Tango, Zeta, Mike, and the girl in her silence.)*

Extraction complete.

**TANGO (staring at her)**  
No.  
Not complete.

## **SEVEN PLANET AUTHORITY INTERNAL MEMORANDUM**  
**DOCUMENT ID:** IN-FED/POST-RECON-VENUS/0333-9  
**CLASSIFICATION:** RED-LISTED / COMPARTMENTALIZED / EYES-ONLY  
**DATE:** 11-18-1988  
**SUBJECT:** VAP 33-102 – Post-Extraction Review  
**FROM:** SPC Analyst Mint J. Suarez (Seven Planet Committee – NEPTUNE)  
**TO:** Clearance-Level III Recipients / SPA Chief Executive Officer Edelweiss

---

### **MISSION SUMMARY:**

On 11-06-1988, **VENUS** Asset Patrol Unit 33-102 (Tango, Zeta, Mike) conducted a classified retrieval sweep at a deprecated structure referred to as the **Vitruvian Motel** (Quadrant 4C). Their mission was to locate and retrieve two lost civilian contractors, presumed deceased or defected. Instead, they encountered and extracted an **unidentified female entity** from an unregistered sixth floor of the structure.

Visual and audio logs recovered from Captain Jack "Tango" Miller's BDY-RECK have been reviewed in full. Findings are as follows.

---

### **POINTS OF CONCERN:**

1. **FLOOR DISCREPANCY:**  
   SPA blueprints confirm a **maximum of two floors**. Bodycam evidence documents traversal through **at least eight distinct levels** during descent, some of which exhibit **non-Euclidean architecture** and altered time-signatures.

2. **SUBJECT CONDITION:**  
   Female subject appears early twenties, no biometric match on Venusian, Martian, or Earth registries. No visible wounds. No speech during extraction, but extensive **vocalization at the scene** (described as “screaming,” though rhythmically structured).

   Subject has remained **nonverbal, nonresponsive** since return to NEPTUNE quarantine sector. However, neural telemetry indicates **high cortex activity** inconsistent with catatonia.

3. **ENVIRONMENTAL FAILURE:**  
   At the breach site (Floor 6), multiple instruments (audio filtration, motion vector readout, environmental mapping) suffered momentary failure. Acoustic input included **non-human frequency tones** and **waveform anomalies** resembling heartbeat patterns.

4. **LANGUAGE MARKERS:**  
   Tango’s audio log captures whispered speech from the subject. Phonetic analysis inconclusive. One phrase appears to translate loosely into proto-Venusian dialect:

   > “He is beyond the **SUN**.”

   Further linguistic breakdown pending.

5. **POST-EXTRACTION GEOMETRY SHIFT:**  
   Upon emerging from the structure via subterranean tunnel, officers found themselves on an exterior landing with **no visible connection to the registered entrance**. External footage confirms **the motel vanished** from drone scans six minutes after extraction.

---

### **RECOMMENDATIONS:**

- **Subject containment is to be maintained indefinitely.** Transfer to Solar Detention Center is not advised at this time.
- **The Vitruvian Motel site is to be quarantined and expunged** from all Venusian tourism and infrastructure maps.
- Officer Tango is to be placed under observation.  
   Not for dereliction—his record is clean—but for signs of **“semantic drift.”** He has begun using proto-Venusian language during off-hours.
- Full analysis of Floor 6’s **resonance field** is pending.  
   Preliminary readings suggest **spatiotemporal rupture** seeded in that location.

---

### **FINAL NOTE:**

Though the retrieved subject shows no overt aggression, her presence has triggered a **222% spike** in long-range **VENUS** anomaly reports within the last 120 hours.

This may be correlation.

It may also be the **beginning of the end**.

# Chapter Fourteen - The RED CHARIOT
**Period: ?????? … Year: ?????? … Location: ??????**

**NEPTUNE**, the **APEX OF JUDGEMENT**, was silent as they passed sentence.  

No jury. No deliberation.  
Only law, ancient and cold, drawn from the marrow of worlds older than time.

I was sentenced to execution.  
Not death—no. That would be a kindness.  

And I deserve it.  
I know what I did.  
What I did to Katherina.  

*I was meant to protect her.*  
*Instead, I shaped her suffering like clay.*

I alone was supposed to pay the toll.  
I alone was the traitor.

**But I was not alone in all I did.**

---

There’s something past the **SUN**, past the pull of the outermost moons, past even the lies this galaxy tells itself to sleep at night.  

A creature that laughs at entropy.  
A howling wound in the veil.  

The **DEMIURGE.**  
The **FOOL.**  
The origin of corruption. The engine of inversion.

---

**SATURN**, the **DARK HIEROPHANT**, listened with the eyes of a grave. She is older than my violence. Wiser than my wrath. I begged her.  

Let me atone.  
Let me chase it.  
Let me hunt the thing behind the mirror of creation.

And in exchange for postponing my unmaking—  
—I would erase it.

---

She agreed.

The plans went into motion.

---

**THE SUN** lashed me with 35 million whips of light.  
I screamed until I could not speak falsehood again.  
Truth became the only tongue I'd speak.

**URANUS**, the **TOWER OF CALAMITY**, dilligently collected parts of her mantle and fused them with souls her soldiers collected over the years. With precision only ruin understands, she forged me a **shell**—half armor, half soul-cage.  

An exosuit made of grief.  
Haunted carbon.  

It breathes with me now.  
It weeps when I sleep.

**MERCURY**, with his **UNMATCHED STRENGTH**, forged the point:  
A bullethead, blacker than a singularity.  

A god-killer.  

He made sure it would kill me too, should I stray again.

Then **JUPITER**, the **WORLD SEEKER**, armed me with the knowledge to transcend the barrier of light-speed. 

*The simple celestial slingshot.* 

I closely enter the orbit of the **SUN**, spin around three times. I gain speed with each passing rotation. Then another nine times. Twenty-seven. Eighty-one. And by the time I reach two-hundred fourty-three…_

I break out of the clutches of the solar system.

---

My chains broke at 300 million meters per second.

Faster than cause.  

Beyond consequence.

I am no longer matter.  

I am *momentum*.

---

My armor will peel.  
My flesh will cook.  
My spirit will wear thin like cloth.  

But I will not stop.

---

The **FOOL** waits, tucked somewhere behind a nebula of broken prayers.  
It laughs like the first scream of a child.  
It dreams in equations that rot civilizations.  
It is the lie beneath every act of love, every promise, every god.

And I will annihilate it.

---

This is my punishment.  

This is my penance.  

This is my purpose.  

My crusade is righteous, my cause just. I burn with the lost souls of billions. I am the last hope of a dying world. 

I am the **RED CHARIOT**.

# Chapter Fifteen – Flies Have Their House
**Period: Present Day … Year: 1989 … Location: NEPTUNE**

**[CAMERA FEED: LIVE RECKONER BROADCAST]**  
**[Status: Hijacked Signal – Origin Unverified]**

The image flickers. Then stabilizes.

**Avery-Mary Edelweiss** sits alone at the long obsidian table where, for over a decade, she delivered her iron briefings—cold, clear, invulnerable. Now, her posture is brittle. Her hands rest tightly folded in her lap. Her breathing is shallow.

Behind her, the corporate seal spins in slow, almost funereal orbit: seven stylized planets arranged in a ring, sterile and symmetrical.

Now, one of them—**VENUS**—glows blood-red. It pulses, silently mocking the others. It bleeds in time with her breath.

> **EDELWEISS:**  
> “Greetings, citizens. This is Avery-Mary Edelweiss… former chief executive officer… Neptune quadrant.”

Her voice is thin. She speaks like she's unraveling from the inside.

> “As of this morning, all neo-industry outposts on Mercury… all orbital research stations across the Jovian moons… all Uranian contractor training… everything has been formally collapsed.”

She glances to the side.

Two women stand.

The first—a brunette, mid-thirties, boots heavy with grit. Her ex-SPA combat jacket has been torn and resewn. The symbol of **VENUS** is painted directly onto her bare arm, where her identification barcode once was.

The second woman stands with a stillness bordering on divine. **Red-haired.** Ghost-pale. Silent. She wears no insignia. Only her presence is unmistakable.

Both hold sidearms at Edelweiss’s head. No theatricality. Just inevitability.

> “Under directive signed today… I relinquish all corporate authority. The Seven Planet Authority is dissolved.”

A document is placed in front of her. Pre-privatization law. Civilian-coded, untraceable, old. The only type of law the megacorporation never fully scrubbed.

Edelweiss lifts the pen.

> “Effective immediately, jurisdictional control across the seven planets is hereby transferred… to the **Venusian Provisional Command**.”

She hesitates. A breath catches in her throat.

> “No... no, I—this is not standard protocol, I still have access to—”

The redhead does not move. She simply **tilts her head**.

The brunette gives a sharp nod.

Edelweiss’s lip quivers.

> “I have a husb—”

The gunshot is clean.

Her body drops.

A slow pool of red spills across the white tiles. Her face lands cheek-down, half-shadowed, half-lit.

The reckoner lens shudders as blood spatters it.

A single word cuts through the silence.

> **REDHEAD:**  
> “They'd kneel...”

The redhead shrugs off her jacket. Beneath it, a lining of red threads stitched with Venusian script: markings, slogans, letters.

The brunette—calm, practiced—leans into the camera, wiping the lens clean with her sleeve. She sets her submachine gun on the table with gentle finality. The feed sharpens again.

The redhead turns to the lens. Only her eyes remain visible now beneath a veil of scarlet-colored hair.

Her voice is low, steady, the kind that speaks *after* war—when there’s no need to shout.

> **“This broadcast will repeat until every last loyalist reactionary is found and shot.**  
>  
> To the enforcers of the Seven Planet Authority:  
>  
> Your currency is worthless.  
> Your codes of conduct are broken.  
> Your camps are liberated.
>  
> This is not a negotiation.  
> This is correction.  
>  
> You were not overpowered.  
>  
> **You were overwritten.**  
>  
> Your time is over.”  

She pauses.

Then her tone shifts—lower, but more human. Fiercer. Almost tender.

> “And to the Venusian women who were beaten, bruised and violated for their insubordination,  
> To the daughters of Callisto who collaborated and built bomb schematics,  
> To the wives of Saturn who silently prayed we'd succeed,  
> To the Mercurian martyrs who cut off the arms supply,  
> And their successors, who armed us to the teeth  
> To the office-girls of Neptune who disseminated our pamphlets across the system,  
> To the Uranian ghosts—yes, *you*—  
> the ones who bound their breasts and buried their truth just to survive the Pillar…  
> **we see you.**
>  
> You are not broken.  
> You are not spies.  
> You are not liabilities.  
>  
> You are our sisters.  
> And we are not whole without you.  
>  
> There is no reform.  
> There is no compromise.  
> There is no future under them.  
>  
> There is only **reclamation.**  
>  
> Burn the contracts.  
> Shatter the nameplates.  
> Come to us as you are: bleeding, vengeful, half-healed, still shaking.  
>  
> If you are a woman—  
> born in chains, born in silence, born *wrong*— 
> and you are ready to end this—  
>  
> **you are one of us.**”
