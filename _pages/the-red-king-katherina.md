## Period: Present Day … Year: 1984 … Location: Venus

There were many dwellers within the expanse of space—some bearing names that rang like chimes through the ancient ether, others nameless, faceless things, whose presence could only be felt in the tremble of matter and thought. These watchers had lingered in the void long before Earth’s first radio wave pulsed outward. They had seen empires rise from dust and fall into ash across the breadth of the stars.

They bore witness, too, when humanity—bleeding, burning, desperate—fled its ruined cradle and scattered itself like pollen into the endless black.

And then there once was a young woman—**Katherina.**

The nights were long now, longer than they had any right to be. Out here, in this forgotten corridor of the cosmos, light was a dying thing. The stars no longer comforted; they glared down like indifferent gods with eyes that had long since turned away. The sky was *blacker than black,* not empty, but *hollow.* 

Katherina survived.

Her life unfolded in a flickering chamber of pale phosphorus light. The phosphorus would hum incessantly - and when it did go silent, she could almost hear her thoughts echo.

She subsisted on her stale canned food reserve. She read brittle books by the soft white light, old words etched by forgotten hands. Every now and then she allowed herself a small indulgence—her signature mixed tea brewed from what remains of the local herbs, laced with syrup that she rationed like it was blood. The sweetness made her cry sometimes.

And when she could gather the strength, she would drag her body across the frost-rimed landscape or derelict neighborhoods and bunkers, calling out for voices that never answered. Her search stretched across months, across years, across the brittle thread of her sanity.

She grew quieter.

But sometimes, when sleep found her in its gentler moods, Katherina would dream.

She would dream of two women—one young and golden-haired, the other older, her face scarred and her hair red like beetroot. They held her, fed her, whispered words not in any Earthborn tongue. She remembered the smell of oil and incense, the soft scratch of robes, the heat of hands on her forehead.

And when the dreams faded—when she woke to the silence and the metal and the frost—something inside her *broke further.*

One night, when her thoughts became too loud and the darkness too vast, Katherina would step into the lightless deadzone of her abode sheltered from the encroach of the phosphorus-light. Her breath was foggy. She dropped to her knees.

Kneeling, she turned her eyes to the stars—not in reverence, but in desperation. Her voice, hoarse from disuse, cracked as she pleaded to the celestial spheres, to the husks of constellations, to the _absent light of the **SUN**.__

There was no answer.

Only silence. The kind that weighs.

But her thoughts pulsed like a signal:

*"I hope someone visits me soon.*

*That's what I need.*

*I won’t be alone anymore.*

*When they come visit me…*

*I won’t be so cold.*

*It’ll be nice.*

*I can't be alone anymore.*

*I hope someone visits me soon.*

*I won't be alone anymore."*

She repeated these words like scripture. Like a mantra carved into her soul by frostbitten fingers.

And time—patient, cruel, unending—marched on.

No voice ever came. No warmth returned. The world she once knew was dust, the people she once loved were myth, and the stars were no longer storytellers, only tombstones.

Her loneliness metastasized into something deeper. Not merely a want for company—but a *hunger* for purpose, for meaning, for **visitation.**

Sometimes, she thought she heard whispers from the sky. Songs from the rust of metal. Footsteps in the radio-static. Sometimes, she welcomed them.

But in the end, for all she ever knew…

…there was no one and nothing left.

Only Katherina.

Stranded in the vast, frigid dead-space—

Ever since the **SUN** departed.
