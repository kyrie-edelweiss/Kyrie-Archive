# Period: Present Day … Year: 1987 … Location: Venus

Tonight was silent.

The only method **MARS** would communicate with Katherina was by reading her mind. And inserting his words there. The nights that he'd take over her body were the worst. But tonight was quiet & still – not like Katherina felt the concept of day & night, whatnot with the **SUN** gone and all.

She did not think of what she was about to do. Her own thoughts would betray her. Katherina can't afford that.

As she feigned the usual bed routine - brisk dip in the lake, drying off her body and touching up her hair, rubbing some of the local vegetation on her teeth…

She slipped up. She had the thought.

**MARS**, in a fraction of a second, knew. The radio-waves travel fast.

Katherina's mind was flooded with the worst **MARS** could muster – Sinner, wrong doer, evil doer, worker of iniquity, a bad example, scoundrel, villain, knave, viper, wretch, the devil incarnate, monster, demon, fallen angel, lost sheep, black sheep, a loafer and a sneak. A good for nothing fucking bitch and a whore.

And she felt her legs giving way, she felt weak, she felt sick to her stomach, she felt like she was losing control over her body. No. Her body was being taken from her.

No. My body is being taken away from me again. You took my mind already.

Leave me alone.

**"LEAVE ME ALONE."**

**"MY SOUL IS FLAWLESS AND PURE. MY SOUL IS FLAWLESS AND PURE."**

**"I DISREGARD THE PRECAUTIONS."** 

**"I WANT TO BREAK."**

In a swift motion, **KATHERINA** swiped her hand across the night sky, thinking she can take him down with her.

Thoughts run down, drip down, become reality. The curse of the **RED KING**.

**MARS** was plucked. She held him in her hands.

Then, a flash. Her eyes went blind.

The truth was there. 

Mars was hiding the **SUN**.

Mars hid the **SUN** from **KATHERINA**.

Mars hid the **SUN** from Venus.

Mars hid the **SUN** from millions.

Mars was responsible.

Mars would be sorry.

Mars was the night, the nightmare.
