## Period: Present Day … Year: 1987 … Location: Venus  

Tonight was silent.  

He wasn’t speaking tonight.  
Not aloud. Not through the crackling wires, not through the walls or the machines.  
**MARS** didn’t need to anymore.  

He preferred the inside of her skull.

His voice burrowed, uninvited, into her thoughts. Sometimes as words. Sometimes just a pressure behind the eyes.
Some nights, he would press into her muscles, inhabit them, wear her bones like clothes.

Walked her across the room.  
Made her smile.  
Made her beg.  
Made her touch herself.

But tonight?  
Stillness.  

Katherina had learned not to *think*.  

Thinking was dangerous.  
A single wrong phrase, a flicker of doubt—  
and he’d could be inside her again.  

So she went through the motions.  

As she feigned the usual bedtime routine - brisk dip in the lake, drying off her body and touching up her hair, rubbing some of the local vegetation on her teeth…

She slipped up.  

She had it. She had the thought.

And like a hand to the throat—  
He was there.  

No warning. No chance.  

Her skull *split open* with his voice.  

> **SINNER, WRONG DOER, EVIL DOER, WORKER OF INIQUITY, A BAD EXAMPLE, SCOUNDREL, VILLAIN, KNAVE, VIPER, WRETCH, THE DEVIL INCARNATE, MONSTER, DEMON, FALLEN ANGEL, LOST SHEEP, BLACK SHEEP, A LOAFER AND A SNEAK. A GOOD FOR NOTHING FUCKING BITCH AND A WHORE.**

It wasn’t just noise.  
It was *penetration*.  

He entered her thoughts like a blade.  
Slid into the gaps of her memories.  
Flooded every synapse with his filth.  
Took her body from her, again.  

She felt weak. She felt her legs move without consent. She felt sick to her stomach.
Her mouth twitch. Her spine arch.

_"leave me alone. you have my body already, let the rest of me be"_

But he was inside already.  
And she couldn’t scream without him tasting it.

*“leave me alone. leave me alone. please don't do it again, please, i can't do it anymore.”*

Her voice sounded so far away.

_“leave m_**E ALONE.”**

**“LEAVE ME ALONE.”**

**“MY SOUL IS FLAWLESS AND PURE.”**

**“I DISREGARD THE PRECAUTIONS.”**

**“I WANT TO BREAK.”**

And that’s when something would break.
Not inside her.  
*But in the sky.*

**KATHERINA**'s hand rose—unthinking. Instinctual.  
Like Venus herself moved through her veins.  

She struck upward.  

Tore at the heavens with thought turned to weapon.

The sky peeled.  
The stars *shivered*.
Her thoughts ran down, dripped down, became reality.
The curse of the **RED KING**.

And Mars came undone.  

**KATHERINA** pulled him down.  
Ripped him from the black.  
Held him—smaller than ever—in her hand.  

And then—  
**the flash.**

Blinding.
Yellow.
Revealed.

And there it was — what Mars hid all this time. The truth she was *raped* away from knowing.

> The **SUN**.  
> Still shining. Still burning.  
> Hidden behind Mars.  

He had hidden the dawn.  

He stole the light,  
stole the warmth,  
stole *the life itself*—  

—from **KATHERINA**.  
—from *Venus*.  
—from *everyone*.  

Mars had done it.

He had silenced the world in shadow and called it "love."

> Mars wasn’t love.  
> He was *control*.  
> He was the night.  
> He was the nightmare.  
> The thing that whispers _“you’ll never be free.”_ 

But **KATHERINA** had ripped him out.  

Mars was responsible.

Mars would be sorry.

Mars was the night, the nightmare.
