# Period: Present Day … Year: 1984 … Location: Venus

Katherina was laid upon her bed, half-dreaming, after voraciously consuming the latest find that she'd tossed in the Venusian literature pile…

'Til in the corner of her half-lucid eye, a massive shadow creeped on her thigh… then to her chest… then this shadow would envelop her.

The crackle of thunder in the sky would stop, and the thick fume of air would stand still, and behind her half-sleeping body, beyond the corner of her window, would stand still the gaze of **MARS** himself.

Shudders of fear would grip her mind, as her eyes met the red planet, which got closer and closer to her, and her dreams would run away, and she'd start to awake, and she'd reach for the knife in the bedside table…

A voice echoes across the room – no, across Venus itself:

**"LITTLE GIRL."**

Katherina screamed like a banshee. The sound pierced her, it was overwhelming her, it was so, so, so loud... the bedframe would rattle…

The same voice continues:

**"YOU RUN TOO FAR IN THE DARK AND YOU GET YOURSELF LOST."**

She takes a good look – she's not in any dream no more, this is as real as it gets. Her pleading was finally answered, but not by whom she expected to answer. This was **MARS**, the full **MARS**, the fourth planet from the **SUN**.

Then the **RED KING** would reassure her, more quiet this time:

**"CALM DOWN. I AM WHOLE. I CAN MAKE YOU WHOLE."**

She opens her mouth…

She starts telling him how alone she'd been, and how there's no one left, and how she'd searched everywhere, and how she stockpiled her rations into boxes upon boxes of the stuff, and how she doesn't even know if she has a mother or a father, and that she can't remember her childhood and finally she tells him that her name is Katherina.

This noise would no longer rattle her entire home. And it'd start to no longer rattle her soul:

**"WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NAME, LITTLE GIRL."**
