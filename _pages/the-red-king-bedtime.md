# Period: Present Day … Year: 1984 … Location: Venus

Katherina & **MARS** would have several discussions about her life over that feverish dream of an hour. She'd sit on the edge of her bed facing the window & he, despite the lack of face, would seem more and more interested.

. . .

During the heated discussion, Katherina lets out a sly remark about her desires, and what she knew of the men that roamed Venus. **MARS** is quick to notice this, and interjects:

**"I'M THE PERFECT MAN. I AM THE CONCEPT OF MAN. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER LIKE ME."**

She's interested. They talk about this for a while.

. . .

Eventually, she asks what happened to the other humans, and what happened to the stars in the night-sky. **MARS** proclaims:

**"THE OTHERS ARE GONE. THEY ABANDONED US."**

Katherina is shocked – it seems that he doesn't know precisely what happened either, just that they're gone. **MARS** then adds:

**"IT'S JUST US NOW. IT'S JUST US NOW."**

The girl agrees. They continue to discuss this for a solid ten minutes, until **MARS** sets the facts straight:

**"THEY RAVAGED IT. ALL OF IT. THERE'S NOTHING LEFT."**

She now knows that the Venusian humans destroyed eachother in a war.

**"NOT JUST THE HUMANS. THE STARS TOO, IN THEIR OWN WAY."**

And she learns that the stars did the same to eachother.

**"THEIR POINTLESS WARS... THERE'S NOTHING LEFT."**

The wars were pointless for both humans & stars.

**"WE ONLY HAVE EACHOTHER. IT'S ALL THEIR FAULT."**

Katherina agrees with his statements. They continue to discuss other topics.

. . .

After a while, they reach the topic of their future. **MARS** would set the tone:

**"IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY NOW. THIS COLD PLACE IS OUR HOME. WE WILL MAKE IT OUR HOME."**

The girl follows the idea of his plans, and they agree that it's in their best interest to build a home atop the remains of Venus. **MARS** reminds her:

**"YOU DON'T HAVE TO BURDEN YOURSELF WITH THIS. REMEMBER, YOU CAN BACK OUT ANYTIME."**

She quickly answers.

**"I UNDERSTAND."**

The air is still for a brief second. Then **MARS** asks:

**"DO YOU LOVE ME?"**
