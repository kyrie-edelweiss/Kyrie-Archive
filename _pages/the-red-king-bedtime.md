## Period: Present Day … Year: 1984 … Location: VENUS

_The phosphorus light trembled like a candle lost in a cavernous lung. Outside, the sulfurous wind hissed its muted lullaby. Inside, the air was *thick*—syrupy with heat and pressure and the scent of something ancient._

Katherina sat upright upon her narrow bed, posture brittle but poised, facing the frost-veined window like it was an altar. Beyond the fogged pane, in that strange depthless black where the stars had once sung, the shape waited. Not hovering. Not looming.

Simply *there*.

**MARS** had no face—but somehow she could feel the weight of his eyes. The curve of attention. His silence was not absence, but *invitation.*

They *spoke*.

For an hour or more—though time had long since become a concept for the desperate—they traded truths like relics. Her voice was coarse, shaped by long disuse and colder nights. His voice, by contrast, was monolithic. Not loud. *Large.* A sound that filled space and bone and the narrowing corridors of her mind.

She told him of her loneliness. Of the dead cities. The old names. The taste of ration-syrup and the tea that made her weep. She told him of her searching, of the bunkers, the towers, the bones she whispered to. Of her mothers—real or imagined—and of the dreams where hands stroked her hair and kissed her third eye.

He listened.

And then, somewhere between a laugh and a confession, Katherina made a sly remark—about the *men* of Venus, or rather, the lack of them. The hollow ones, the cruel ones, the weak ones. She spoke of longing. Of hunger. Of the heat between her thighs that not even prayer could soothe.

**MARS** did not pause. He *declared*:

> **"I AM THE PERFECT MAN. I AM THE CONCEPT OF MAN. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER LIKE ME."**

His words did not warm her. They *pierced* her. Something inside her clenched—not in fear, but in awe. In recognition.

They discussed this—what it meant to *be* a man, a god, a concept made flesh through will and violence and memory. And desire.

Then she asked about the others.

The voices once heard across the stars. The transmissions. The colonies. The laughter and horror of a species that once scattered like pollen into the cosmic wind.

**MARS** responded like scripture:

> **"THE OTHERS ARE GONE. THEY ABANDONED US."**

She reeled. But not because he knew. Because he *didn’t*. He, too, was unsure. They had simply… vanished.

He repeated, quieter this time, but with twice the weight:

> **"IT’S JUST US NOW.  
> IT’S JUST US NOW."**

The echo sank into her ribs. She nodded.

The conversation twisted again—spiraled downward like a bloody offering down a stone drain.

> **"THEY RAVAGED IT,"** he said, **"ALL OF IT. THERE’S NOTHING LEFT."**

War. Starfire. Collapse. The death of Venusian cities, the fracturing of mind and memory and myth.

> **"NOT JUST THE HUMANS.  
> THE STARS TOO, IN THEIR OWN WAY."**

> **"THEIR POINTLESS WARS…  
> THERE’S NOTHING LEFT."**

And that was truth.

Not spoken. *Etched.*

> **"WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER.  
> IT’S ALL THEIR FAULT."**

Katherina did not resist this truth. She *absorbed* it. Welcomed it like warmth on a frostbitten palm. Their world—ravaged, starless, orphaned—was still *theirs.*

They spoke further. Of survival. Of purpose. Of becoming more than the echo of a dead race.

And then, **MARS**, with the slow gravity of inevitability, said:

> **"IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY NOW.  
> THIS COLD PLACE IS OUR HOME.  
> WE WILL MAKE IT OUR HOME."**

His voice was not pleading. It was *sovereign.*

She did not hesitate. She understood.

But **MARS** paused—perhaps for the first time—and offered her a way out:

> **"YOU DON’T HAVE TO BURDEN YOURSELF WITH THIS.  
> REMEMBER, YOU CAN BACK OUT ANYTIME."**

Katherina answered without blinking:

> **"I UNDERSTAND."**

A breathless pause followed. The light dimmed further. Outside, the shape in the void seemed to lean *closer.*

And then, softly—like a knife kissing skin:

> **"DO YOU LOVE ME?"**
