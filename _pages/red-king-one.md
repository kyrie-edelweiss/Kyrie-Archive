# Chapter Three - Katherina
**KATHERINA SERIES**  
**YEAR OF RECORD:** Early 1984  
**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Former Commune Zone, Southern Acid Belt  
**STATUS:** Person of Interest

There were many dwellers within the expanse of space—some bearing names that rang like chimes through the ancient ether, others nameless, faceless things, whose presence could only be felt in the tremble of matter and thought. These watchers had lingered in the void long before Earth’s first radio wave pulsed outward. They had seen empires rise from dust and fall into ash across the breadth of the stars.

They bore witness, too, when humanity—bleeding, burning, desperate—fled its ruined cradle and scattered itself like pollen into the endless black.

And then there once was a young woman—**Katherina.**

The nights were long now, longer than they had any right to be. Out here, in this forgotten corridor of the cosmos, light was a dying thing. The stars no longer comforted; they glared down like indifferent gods with eyes that had long since turned away. The sky was *blacker than black,* not empty, but *hollow.* 

Her life unfolded in a flickering chamber of pale phosphorus light. The phosphorus would hum incessantly - and when it did go silent, she could almost hear her thoughts echo.

She subsisted on her stale canned food reserve. She read brittle books by the soft white light, old words etched by forgotten hands. Every now and then she allowed herself a small indulgence—her signature mixed tea brewed from what remains of the local herbs, laced with syrup that she rationed like it was blood. The sweetness made her cry sometimes.

And when she could gather the strength, she would drag her body across the frost-rimed landscape or derelict neighborhoods and bunkers, calling out for voices that never answered. Her search stretched across months, across years, across the brittle thread of her sanity.

She grew quieter.

But sometimes, when sleep found her in its gentler moods, Katherina would dream.

She would dream of two women—one young and golden-haired, the other older, her face scarred and her hair red like beetroot. They held her, fed her, whispered words not in any Earthern tongue. She remembered the smell of oil and incense, the soft scratch of robes, the heat of hands on her forehead.

And when the dreams faded—when she woke to the silence and the metal and the frost—something inside her *broke further.*

One night, when her thoughts became too loud and the darkness too vast, Katherina would step into the lightless deadzone of her abode sheltered from the encroach of the phosphorus-light. Her breath was foggy. She dropped to her knees.

Kneeling, she turned her eyes to the stars—not in reverence, but in desperation. Her voice, hoarse from disuse, cracked as she pleaded to the celestial spheres, to the husks of constellations, to the _absent light of the **SUN**._

There was no answer.

Only silence. The kind that weighs.

And then her thoughts spiral from there:

*"I hope someone visits me soon.*  
*That's what I need.*  
*I won’t be alone anymore.*  
*When they come visit me…*  
*I won’t be so cold.*  
*It’ll be nice.*  
*I can't be alone anymore.*  
*I hope someone visits me soon.*  
*I won't be alone anymore."*

She repeated these words like scripture. Like a mantra carved into her soul by frostbitten fingers.

And time—patient, cruel, unending—marched on.

No voice ever came. No warmth returned. The world she once knew was dust, the people she once loved were myth, and the stars were no longer storytellers, only tombstones.

Her loneliness metastasized into something deeper. Not merely a want for company—but a *hunger* for purpose, for meaning, for **visitation.**

Sometimes, she thought she heard whispers from the sky. Songs from the rust of metal. Footsteps in the radio-static. Sometimes, she welcomed them.

But in the end, for all she ever knew…

…there was no one and nothing left.

Only Katherina.

Stranded in the vast, frigid dead-space—

Ever since the **SUN** departed.

# Chapter Four - The Red King
**KATHERINA SERIES – CONTACT**  
**YEAR OF RECORD:** Mid 1985  
**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** VENUS – Former Commune Zone, Southern Acid Belt  
**STATUS:** To Be Monitored – Long-Term Psychological Deterioration Logged

Katherina lay draped across her narrow bed, limbs slack, eyes fluttering beneath pale lids—half-sunken in sleep, half-hungering still. She had devoured another text from the Venusian archive, a brittle book bound in leather-soft skin, its pages soaked in language that shimmered like oil under her flickering phosphorus light. She’d read it cover to cover, mouth parted in trance, and tossed it into the growing pile beside her—*The Liturgies of the Fleshbound Womb*, or something like that.

The air around her pulsed with faint heat. Her mind flickered between dream and waking.

Then, in the corner of her softening sight—*a shadow.*

First upon her thigh. Then sliding upward across her ribs, to her chest, like a hand made not of matter but *pressure.* The room dimmed further, and the breath in her lungs felt thick with iron. The shadow moved—not quickly, not violently—but *deliberately*, with the certainty of something that had been waiting far too long.

The thunder that once rumbled in the high sky fell silent.

Even the low, constant hum of Venus's acidic winds held its breath.

And in the stillness—beyond the glass of her narrow window, past the ragged clouds of sulfur and rain—stood something massive.

It did not blink. It did not move.  
But it *watched.*

**MARS.**  
The **RED KING**.

And Katherina, paralyzed in that dim room, felt her thoughts collapse like ash. Her skin turned to glass. Her blood grew cold. She tried to scream, to call out, but only breath escaped—wet and useless.

Her hand reached for the knife in the bedside drawer—a rusted little thing, barely sharper than a spoon—but even that small act felt impossible beneath that *gaze.*

And then—like thunder cracking across her bones—a voice:

**"LITTLE GIRL."**

It did not echo through the room.

It echoed through Venus.

Through the soil. Through the metal. Through the marrow of her bones.

Katherina shrieked—a sound ragged and primal, torn from the darkest place inside her. The bedframe shook beneath her, groaning like it too feared what had come.

And again, the voice:

**"YOU RUN TOO FAR IN THE DARK…  
AND YOU GET YOURSELF LOST."**

Something changed. The dream peeled back. This was not a vision. This was not fantasy or delusion or fever-born madness. This was *now.* This was *real.*

Her pleading had been answered—not by the star-eyed mothers, not by the Watchers, not by Venus, but by **MARS.**

And he had come in *full.*

The silence thickened. Her chest heaved. The lightbars flickered and dimmed, flickered and died.

And then, softer this time. Like fire warming cold hands:

**"CALM DOWN. I AM WHOLE.  
I CAN MAKE YOU WHOLE."**

Katherina opened her mouth. She did not scream.

She *spoke* to him.

She told him how alone she was. How long she had wandered. How there were no voices left. How she had searched every place, every spot, every echo. How her memories were slipping from her. How she stockpiled rations into boxes and boxes of the stuff. How she no longer remembered the faces of her mothers, or if they had ever loved her, or if they were even real. And how her name is *Katherina*.

She told him how she had waited.

And waited.

And *waited.*

Something inside her soul — *something frayed and near-broken* — stilled.

And then:

**"WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NAME."**

The voice no longer rattled her teeth. The bed no longer trembled.

No one had told her anything like that in so long. Not the stars. Not the transmission beacons she activated every year.

And now here he was.

Something ancient. Something opposite.

But not cruel.

**[VOICE – FEMALE, MID-30s, SMOKY ACCENT]**

*"I used to iron their sheets. Every morning, before shift. You could still smell the oil from the drills when you held the corners."*  

**[LAUGHTER – MULTIPLE WOMEN, DISTORTED]**
 
*"There was a girl in our complex. She'd always tuck her hair in a ponytail, and we’d pass her the ration powder first like she was a captain. One time she traded an entire night's sleep for three hormone capsules smuggled in through Callisto. I never asked how she knew which guards were stupid."*  

*"...She didn’t talk about who she was. She didn’t have to."*  

*"She looked like she was falling apart—like someone who'd survived telling them 'no.'"*

*"She’d go out at night and rewire the speakers. Found tapes, not from SPA, not from anyone official. Songs. Women reading poems. Women screaming. And one time, this woman—hollow voice, flat like concrete—she just says, over and over, distorted in static:*

*‘What they made you isn’t what you are.’"*  

**[AUDIO GLITCH – 13 SECONDS OF SILENCE]**

*"Venus was always too hot for dreams. The walls sweated. The oxygen was thin and bitter. They kept the lights tuned to colors that made you forget time—said it improved productivity. No clocks. No mirrors. Just efficiency."*  

*"When we bled, they made us work with it in. Said it built tolerance. When we cried, they lowered our rations. Said hydration needed incentive."*  

*"...That girl—Flicker, we called her—she never looked hungry, even when she was. She had this way of looking through you."*  

*"She taught us things without saying them. Like how to cough once before a false shift report. How to tell the difference between corrective officers and their inspectors by the shape of their boots. How to leave messages in the scent-coding of cleaning fluid."*  
 
_"After her, it stopped being about escape. It started being about inheritance. About building something that'd last, that **they couldn’t take away from us.**"_  

*"They caught her in 1948. Stripped her naked in front of the wall. Said she was ‘trying to corrupt the servile system.’ But I remember this—she smiled. Even with her jaw busted open. Smiled like she’d already made it out."*  

**[VOICE CRACKLES BACK IN – NEW SPEAKER, YOUNG, BREATHLESS]**  

*"She didn’t just smuggle tapes. She smuggled the idea that we could have voices. She left holes in the walls where we could plant them."*  

_"...I don’t remember her real name. But we called her **Flicker.**"_  

*"And every time they'd raid our dorms for contraband and come back empty handed? Every time they'd drop dead, and the company would file it as 'sudden heart failure'? Every time a girl disappears for three nights and then **doesn't** come back bruised and beaten?"*

**[BOTH SPEAKERS OVERLAP]**

*"That’s Flick."*

**[VOICE – MALE, MID-50s, HOARSE BUT CONTROLLED]**

_“They called it **Asset Conditioning**. I called it paperwork.”_

*“I worked in the Correctional Oversight Department—Venus branch. Mid-floor. Nobody important. My job was to certify the behavioral assessments for serviles who ‘failed compliance.’ Not the punishment. Just the process around it.”*

**[AUDIO: AMBIENT OFFICE NOISE – FAINT PRINTER WHIRR, AIR RECIRCULATORS, DISTANT DRONING]**

*“You’d get these reports—lines of numbers. Emotional volatility, libido productivity, obedience latency, fertility status. It all looked clean. Math always does.”*  
*“The girls weren’t numbers, though. Not really. They were test cases. Every month, they’d slip new protocols into the system. Quietly. No memos. Just new checkboxes.”*

_‘Has she made eye contact for more than 3.4 seconds?’  
‘Has she asked to keep her original name?’  
‘Has she formed unapproved intra-sex bonds?’  
‘Does she exhibit… **independent linguistic framing?**’”_

**[PAUSE – BREATHING AUDIBLY THROUGH NOSE]**

*“You know what ‘independent linguistic framing’ means? It means she used a word we didn’t teach her.”*

*“If the girls scored red on more than two flags, the report went to VAP. From there, I didn’t see anything. Just reassignment notices. Or deletion codes.”*

*“Once, a girl wrote ‘no’ in chalk. On the side of a ration bin. Small, faint. Someone caught it. Her number was V-76-E. I still remember that. VAP came in within the hour. Two guards. One nurse.”*

*“I signed the removal form. I didn’t even have to type it. The system filled it out automatically. Just needed a biometric pulse. I gave it mine.”*

**[AUDIO: PAPER SHUFFLING, THEN A DEEP EXHALE]**

*“They weren’t even hiding it. That was the part that got me. The cruelty wasn’t masked. It was modular.”*

*“There’s this protocol—Section 14/9b. Internal term: ‘Divergent Correctional Intimacy.’ I thought it was slang. Until I saw the documentation. Whole programs designed to ‘test the elasticity of feminine behavioral thresholds.’”*

*“They called it elastic. I called it what it was.”*

*“Rape by spreadsheet.”*

**[AUDIO: CHAIR CREAKING, SLIGHT STATIC]**

*“I don’t expect forgiveness. I don’t expect survival. But I kept one file. Just one. Printed it off and fed it through a trash unit marked for sterilization. Burned the rest.”*

*“This is the only copy.”*

*“I’m sending it now. If you get this, you’re either brave or already damned.”*

*“Do something with it.”*

**[VOICE – FEMALE, LATE 20s, TENDER, SLIGHTLY BREATHLESS]**

*“Her hands were always cold at first. They’d warm up under my ribs.”*

*“We worked opposite ends of the facility. I ran maintenance routing—sixteen hours sorting cables that didn’t go anywhere. She was in the chemical rooms. Breathing bleach like perfume. Hands always cracked.”*

*“There was a chute behind the incinerator vent. No reckorders. No sensors. We’d lie on the steel.”*

**[AUDIO: LOW, METALLIC WIND – DISTANT PIPELINE PRESSURE]**

*“She always came to me marked. Scrapes, heat rash, burn lines where the collar stuck to her. I’d press my mouth to every one. Real gentle. Like I was fixing them.”*

*“We never talked about being lovers. That word didn’t exist down there. But sometimes she’d whisper, real quiet, ‘I want to forget the shift code.’ That meant: don’t stop tonight. That meant: take the whole hour.”*

*“We’d slide the uniforms down to the ankles. Lie face to face. Arms hooked together like netting. We never rushed. The longer we went, the more it felt like we were rebelling. Against everything.”*

_“I remember the first time she cried while she was inside me. Said it felt too real. Said it hurt to feel **wanted** without a clipboard.”_

*“I said I’d write her a report if that helped. Three violations of protocol. Two sustained interruptions. One unsanctioned moan.”*

**[AUDIO: SMALL LAUGHTER – BARELY AUDIBLE. SHARED.]**

*“There were times we didn’t even undress. Just held each other through the fabric. She’d say, ‘If we strip too fast they’ll think we’re working again.’”*  

*“Once, after a double shift, we fell asleep like that. Woke up to sirens. Crawled back to our quarters in opposite directions, grease on our thighs. Didn't speak for a week. Thought maybe we’d been flagged.”*

*“But no summons came. No reassignment. No corrections.”*  

*“We were ghosts again.”*

*“We never got caught. Or maybe we did, and they let it happen. Maybe they needed to know what we’d cling to if left unsupervised.”*

*“She’s gone now. Reassigned. That’s what the docket said.”*

*“But when I lie still enough, I swear I can feel her palm again. Cold at first. Always warming.”*

# Chapter Six - Bedtime Stories

_The phosphorus light trembled like a candle lost in a cavernous lung. Outside, the sulfurous wind hissed its muted lullaby. Inside, the air was **thick**—syrupy with heat and pressure and the scent of something ancient._

Katherina sat upright upon her narrow bed, posture brittle but poised, facing the frost-veined window like it was an altar. Beyond the fogged pane, in that strange depthless black where the stars had once sung, the shape waited. Not hovering. Not looming.

Simply *there*.

**MARS** had no face—but somehow she could feel the weight of his eyes. The curve of attention. His silence was not absence, but *invitation.*

They *spoke*.

For an hour or more—though time had long since become a concept for the desperate—they traded truths like relics. Her voice was coarse, shaped by long disuse and colder nights. His voice, by contrast, was monolithic. Not loud. *Large.* A sound that filled space and bone and the narrowing corridors of her mind.

She told him of her loneliness. Of the dead cities. The old names. The taste of ration-syrup and the tea that made her weep. She told him of her searching, of the bunkers, the towers, the bones she whispered to. Of her mothers—real or imagined—and of the dreams where hands stroked her hair.

He listened.

And then, somewhere between a laugh and a confession, Katherina made a sly remark—about the *men* of Venus, or rather, the lack of them. The hollow ones, the cruel ones, the weak ones. She spoke of longing. Of hunger. Of the heat between her thighs that not even prayer could soothe.

**MARS** did not pause. He *declared*:

> **"I AM THE PERFECT MAN. I AM THE CONCEPT OF MAN. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER LIKE ME."**

His words did not warm her. They *pierced* her. Something inside her clenched—not in fear, but in awe. In recognition.

They discussed this—what it meant to *be* a man, a god, a concept made flesh through will and violence and memory. And desire.

Then she asked about the others.

The voices once heard across the stars. The transmissions. The colonies. The laughter and horror of a species that once scattered like pollen into the cosmic wind.

**MARS** responded like scripture:

> **"THE OTHERS ARE GONE. THEY ABANDONED US."**

She reeled. But not because he knew. Because he *didn’t*. He, too, was unsure. They had simply… vanished.

He repeated, quieter this time, but with twice the weight:

> **"IT’S JUST US NOW.  
> IT’S JUST US NOW."**

The echo sank into her ribs. She nodded.

The conversation twisted again—spiraled downward like a bloody offering down a stone drain.

> **"THEY RAVAGED IT,"**
> **"ALL OF IT. THERE’S NOTHING LEFT."**

War. Starfire. Collapse. The death of Venusian cities, the fracturing of mind and memory and myth.

> **"NOT JUST THE HUMANS.  
> THE STARS TOO, IN THEIR OWN WAY."**

> **"THEIR POINTLESS WARS…  
> THERE’S NOTHING LEFT."**

And that was truth.

Not spoken. *Etched.*

> **"WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER.  
> IT’S ALL THEIR FAULT."**

Katherina did not resist this truth. She *absorbed* it. Welcomed it like warmth on a frostbitten palm. Their world—ravaged, starless, orphaned—was still *theirs.*

They spoke further. Of survival. Of purpose. Of becoming more than the echo of a dead race.

And then, **MARS**, with the slow gravity of inevitability, said:

> **"IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY NOW.  
> THIS COLD PLACE IS OUR HOME.  
> WE WILL MAKE IT OUR HOME."**

His voice was not pleading. It was *sovereign.*

She did not hesitate. She understood.

But **MARS** paused—perhaps for the first time—and offered her a way out:

> **"YOU DON’T HAVE TO BURDEN YOURSELF WITH THIS.  
> REMEMBER, YOU CAN BACK OUT ANYTIME."**

Katherina answered without blinking.

> **"I UNDERSTAND."**

A breathless pause followed. The light dimmed further. Outside, the shape in the void seemed to lean *closer.*

And then, softly—like a knife kissing skin:

> **"DO YOU LOVE ME?"**

She blinks.

And something comes back. Not all at once—but like a smell remembered from childhood.

A warm lap.  
Fingers combing through her hair.  
A lullaby hummed off-key.  
The feel of soft cloth draped over her cheek while someone whispered:

*"Shh, little one. You're safe. You're loved. Sleep now."*

There were two voices.  
Two women.  
One spoke with a low, scratchy laugh, like gravel and honey. The other was gentler—young, nervous, always fussing over the blankets. One wore thick gloves from working near acid vents. The other always smelled like tea leaves and salt.

They called her their miracle.  
They made her soup.  
They told her stories about stars.

She remembers lying between them in the dark, the hum of a failing generator overhead, feeling them breathe on either side.

*"You're going to be someone,"* one whispered.  
*"You already are,"* said the other.

But then it changes.

A knock on the metal door.  
A flashlight in her eyes.  
Gloves again—but colder this time. Rougher.  
Voices she didn’t recognize.

*"She’s the one."*  
*"Just sedate her."*

She screamed for her mothers.  
She felt the needle.

And then—

Nothing.

When she gasps back into herself, her hands are curled into fists, pressed to her stomach like she’s trying to hold something in. Her breath hitches.
