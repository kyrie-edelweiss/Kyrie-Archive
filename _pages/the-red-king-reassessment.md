**Period: 8 Years Ago … Year: 1976 … Location: NEPTUNE**

*A dozen people sit in their chairs next to a massive table in a lavishly-decorated and open room. At the end sits an imposing figure with their hands cupped. The figure starts speaking…*

"I'm gonna call everyone's name out while my assistant matches faces to names. Our first meeting has officially begun. Raise your hand when you're called out. Listen up", says the imposing figure.

"Anderson. Ayden. Bernstein. Cat. D'Agostino. Green – You the art specialist? No? Okay… Jones. Kildare. Lamont. Michael. Suarez. Weiss - Oh, you're the art specialist. Zimmer."

"That's everyone? Alright. Good morning. I'm Avery-Mary Edelweiss. I command the entirety of this department. This is William Hertz, my personal assistant. Welcome to the Seven Planet Committee", she says with a half-grin on her wrinkled face.

"First of all: congratulations. We know how much work you put in to get this far, and we know that you've all left behind promising careers in engineering, R&D, finance, defense and so on. Just bear in mind that we know what you've done to get here. This might be the last time you hear these words for a while, so listen real closely: Well done", the woman's voice booms.

*Cat & Suarez share a half-giggle as Anderson, Ayden, Kildare and Weiss clap.*

"Let's get to the point", she continues.

"Thanks to those extremists who've hijacked the Edelweiss Station, the ones who took control of our beloved **VENUS**, and countless other atrocities committed in the name of radical sex supremacy, we've founded this department to crack down on this growing female-led terrorism…", Edelweiss states as a matter-of-fact.

*Green whistles. Then, the room erupts into clapping.*

"These fuckers won't have it easy from this point forward. We'll make their lives a living hell, and we'll destroy what remains of their little revolution. We start from the outer reaches – **NEPTUNE** – and we will uproot these weeds from across all of our planetary provinces", she gestures.

*Hollering, whistling and clapping are heard from all across.*

"I'll let my assistant – William – take it from here. He's a very capable, passionate & smart man."

"**MERCURY:** When they decimated the air filtration plants, they wiped themselves out in the process. So there's nothing left to do there. Cheers to their suicidal urges, and a toast to our growing effort. We will rebuild on their ashes", he says, inviting them to celebrate.

*Everyone involved has a moment of shared laughter.*

"In all seriousity, a moment of silence for all the innocents we've lost on **MERCURY**…", Edelweiss demands.

*The room is still.*

"**VENUS**: The situation is dire."

*A gasp is heard.*

"As the home planet of their inconsequential revolution, this is where they concentrated all their efforts. Our telecommunication grid is offline since 1966, there's no sync installations left, and our local Asset Protection force was pulled back in 1969. We can hence consider every person on **VENUS** a living security threat, and remove them by any means necessary. But in all seriousness, we may never finish the work we started in 1962.", the man says in a grave tone.

"We'll discuss **VENUS** later."

"Earth: What is there to say about Earth? It's dead. We don't recognize it.", William says half-jokingly.

*Green almost musters a sentence, but quickly hesitates.*

"**MARS:** **MARS** was always… odd. Despite being our first colonization candidate, any and all efforts to get ourselves established there have ended in mysterious ways. So we've just never set foot on it ever since, and likely, that's the way it'll always be. The revolution seems to be almost contained by this hunk of red soil… Moving on."

*Cat & Suarez share some remarks between themselves. Jones & Michael follow accordingly.*

"**JUPITER:** Our tiny R&D moons – Io, Europa & Ganymede are fine, they've never had any sex supremacist sentiments and we intend to keep it this way. We'll increase our foothold there by diverting more money. Callisto has had some history now and then, but we're sure it'll be fine."

*Anderson, Green and Zimmer share a glance.*

"**SATURN:** Ever since we've left Earth, we knew - this would be the site of our religious expansion. The people on living **SATURN**'s ring – the 200,000 centers of faith built atop the shattered moons – are zealots by nature and tightly guard their beliefs & ideas atop their gated communities. We don't have to intervene here, and they'd like to keep our intervention minimal anyway."

*Lamont nods approvingly.*

"**URANUS:** We train most of our military & defense contractors here, on the Pillar – a vertical training center & arms factory megastructure that pierces the core of the planet. We've implemented strict directives to execute anyone suspected of Venusian ideals, and as long as we keep these directives under control, we shouldn't have to work on **URANUS** that much."

*Kildare is not surprised.*

"**NEPTUNE:** The seat of management – its bureaucracy represented by the unending tunnels and urban centers built on top of the now-hidden ice. And far, far above, we have the Synchronity Complex. This is the first foothold we establish – if **NEPTUNE** falls, we all fall.", William concludes.

*A thunderous applause echoes in the meeting room.*
