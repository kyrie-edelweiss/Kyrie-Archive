## [BDYRECK – VAP 33-102 – APPROACH PHASE]

**Time Stamp:** 12:43:12

**Location:** Exterior – Vitruvian Motel, Quadrant 4C, **VENUS**

*(Footsteps in dust. Wind blows faintly. Cam shakes as boots crunch over cracked cement. All three officers are on approach: weapons slung low, helmets off. The motel looms ahead—tall, crooked, bleeding rust.)*

**MIKE**
There she is.
The pride of the pre-revolution tourism industry. Fuckin’ two stars, maybe.

**TANGO**
Generous. You can smell the rot from here.

**ZETA**
Focus.

(The camera pans over the building—two floors visible, but the silhouette is wrong. Windows are either boarded or melted inward.)

**ZETA (reading tablet)**
Registry lists it as decommissioned twenty years ago.
Signal pings from two missing contractors came from inside, though.

**TANGO**
Let's take bets-dead or hostages?

**MIKE**
Dead. Deady-dead-dead dead.

**ZETA**
Hostages.

(ZETA walks closer, eyes scanning the entry.)

**TANGO (squinting)**
Hold up. You see that?

*(Tango points up. The camera pans: the windows on the second floor are bricked from the inside—uneven, like done by hand. The door is slightly ajar, but warped inward at the hinge, like something forced its way out.)

**ZETA**
Structural integrity’s shot. Keep eyes on me. Helmets on.

**MIKE (quietly)**
Why’s the door already open?

**TANGO**
They knew we were coming.

(Beat. Silence. Wind shifts.)

**ZETA**
Weapons check. We breach on my mark.

*(Zeta straps his boots tighter.)*

**MIKE**
You ever get the feeling someone's watching you?

TANGO:
No.

*(Pause.)*

**TANGO (softer)**
But I do now.

## [BDYRECK – VAP 33-102 – ENTRY PHASE]

**Time Stamp:** 22:44:01  

**Location:** Interior – Vitruvian Motel, Reception Level

---

*(Door hinges creak. The metal doesn’t resist—it swings inward with the slow exhale of a deep breath. The interior is darker than expected. The camera auto-corrects exposure. The air immediately registers several degrees warmer.)*

**ZETA (flat)**  
VAP 33-102. Entry point breached.  
Natural light waning. Flashlights on.

*(Flashlights snap on with soft mechanical clicks. The beams sweep across a trashed lobby. Furniture is overturned, decomposing. A reception desk sags in on itself. Wallpaper is peeling in wide, vertical strips. Godrays through the boarded windows.)*

**MIKE**  
Okay… this is worse than I expected.

**TANGO**  
You expected better?

**MIKE (gesturing)**  
I mean look at it. That used to be a couch. Now it’s mulch.

**ZETA**  
Focus. Signs of habitation—anything recent?

*(TANGO moves toward the desk. His cam picks up a broken landline, stained not with dust, but with something *damp*. There are no footprints on the floor, just odd drag patterns. Something was moved. Or pulled.)*

**TANGO**
This place smells like old copper and vinegar.

**MIKE:**  
I can hear the ocean.

**ZETA (snaps)**  
There’s no ocean nearby.  
Block that noise out. Stay sharp.

**TANGO (low)**  
He’s not wrong. It’s faint... but it’s there. Rolling tide. Coming from below us?

*(Silence falls. The only sound is distant, rhythmic. Not wind. Not pipes. Not footsteps. But a low **pulling sound**, as if something massive were breathing through layers of walls.)*

---

**ZETA:**  
Reception’s clear.

**TANGO:**
Split and sweep the side halls. Call out what you find.

*(The squad moves. Zeta veers right. Mike takes left. Tango holds centerline. Their lights cut through air thick with invisible moisture. Each beam reveals *no mirrors.* Even where frame outlines remain on the wall—nothing reflective. Nothing watching back.)*

---

**MIKE (softly, to himself)**  
Why seal off the whole place?

**MIKE (O.S.)**  
I’ve got two doors—both locked. This hallway’s a dead end.

**TANGO (O.S.)**  
Same. One partially open. No sound. Doesn’t look disturbed.

**ZETA**  
Lobby level is clear. Proceeding to stairwell.

---

*(ZETA moves ahead. The camera catches one final shot of the lobby—just before they pass into the stairwell: the corner of a painting. Water-damaged, streaked in red. The image is smeared, but some of it remains visible. A **man**. Kneeling. Arms raised. Eyes gone. The title plate beneath it is unreadable.)*

**TANGO (staring)**  
You seeing this?

**ZETA**  
Ignore it.

**MIKE**  
What the hell kind of motel hangs that in the lobby?

*(No response. They move toward the stairwell. The sound of the ocean fades—not disappearing, but **receding**. Like it's waiting for them on another floor.)*

Absolutely. Here’s the continuation: the **stairwell sequence**, as **ZETA**, **TANGO**, and **MIKE** ascend deeper into the **Vitruvian Motel**, heading toward the upper levels—specifically **Floor 6**. The descent into unreality begins here: strange geometries, subtle atmospheric shifts, and the eerie sense that the building is not merely being explored—it is *observing*.

---

## [BDYRECK – VAP 33-102 – STAIRWELL ASCENT]
**Time Stamp:** 22:45:18  
**Location:** Vitruvian Motel – Central Stairwell

---

*(Heavy door creaks open. Flashlights cut through dust-laced dark. The stairwell is narrow, ribbed with old pipes and condensation. The walls sweat. Paint bubbles in long, oozing strips.)*

**ZETA:**  
Stairwell entry confirmed.

**MIKE (quiet):**  
You smell that? It’s different in here.

**TANGO:**  
Yeah. Like boiled metal and damp cloth.  
Same as morgues back on **SATURN.**

---

*(They begin climbing. The steps are slick in places—worn through concrete, not metal. One groans under Mike’s weight. Flashlights wobble on the walls—revealing stains that look like old boot scuffs. Or claw marks. It’s hard to tell.)*

**ZETA:**  
Count your steps.

**TANGO:**  
Why?

**ZETA:**  
If you feel like we’ve gone farther than we should have, I want numbers to prove it.

**MIKE (after a beat):**  
Thirteen... fourteen... fifteen... wait—

**TANGO:**  
We passed the second floor already.

**MIKE:**  
There wasn’t a door.

---

*(They stop. The landing is blank. No signage. No hallway access. Just more stairs. The lighting fades to a dull, wet amber. A subtle hum now permeates the air—a low vibration, like the sound of an engine.)*

**TANGO:**  
You feel that?

**ZETA:**  
I feel it.

**TANGO:**  
Like it’s watching us climb.

---

*(The next landing finally appears—barely different from the last. No signage. Just a wall where a hallway should be. A single light buzzes overhead, dimming every time someone passes beneath.)*

**ZETA:**  
Altitude indicator says we’ve climbed 8 meters. That’s three floors’ worth.

**MIKE:**  
We’ve only seen **one** floor.

**TANGO:**  
So where are the others?

*(Pause.)*

---

**22:46:12 – INTERIOR ANOMALY FLAGGED**

> ***CAM NOTE: Light refraction data inconsistent with building schematic. Internal elevation exceeds external profile.***

---

**TANGO:**  
We’re continuing. No backtracking.

**ZETA:**  
This place doesn’t have floors—it has **layers**.

**MIKE:**  
Yeah? What kind of layers?

**TANGO (grim):**  
Like the layers of hell.

---

*(They pass another landing. The stairwell curves sharper now, like the building’s coiling around them. Shadows deepen. Light sources dwindle. The handrails are damp to the touch—slightly sticky.)*

**MIKE (uneasy):**  
How many more?

**ZETA:**  
Until we find them.

**TANGO:**  
Or they find us.

---

*(They reach a landing with a partially open door. No markings. Just heat spilling from within.  
A hum behind the walls. The sound of **tide**. Not imagined. Not distant.)*

---

**ZETA (quiet):**  
We’re here.

**MIKE:**  
This isn’t Floor 2, is it?

**TANGO:**  
No.  
This is **Floor 6**.

---

## [BDYRECK – VAP 33-102 – FLOOR 6 HALLWAY]
**Time Stamp:** 22:47:22  
**Location:** Vitruvian Motel – Floor 6, East Wing  
**Status:** Active Sweep

---

*(The door creaks as ZETA opens it. The hallway beyond is long, unlit. Their flashlights cut into amber haze. The corridor has no windows, no signs, and no visible end at first. Only silence.)*

**ZETA:**  
Floor 6 confirmed. Proceeding east.  
Eyes sharp. Weapons tight.

**MIKE (low):**  
Where the hell is the light?

**TANGO:**  
Same place the mirrors went.

---

*(They step in. The hallway is too wide for a building this size. The walls are slightly bowed—curved inward like ribs. Floor tiles are damp. Stained.)*

**ZETA (scanning):**  
Four doors. Two left. Two right.  
One at the end.

*(They pause. All the doors are unmarked. Frames are warped—some bloated with moisture, others thinned like something pushed hard against them for years.)*

**TANGO (noting quietly):**  
You see this?

*(TANGO gestures to the floor. Track marks. Scattered. Sharp turns. A pattern of dragging and circular pacing—no shoes.)*

**MIKE:**  
It’s like someone walked in circles… again and again.

**ZETA:**  
We focus on the end door. Sweep and extract.

---

*(As they move, a faint sound begins in the feed: **waves**, slow and deep, muffled like from behind the walls. None of them comment on it yet. None are sure it’s real.)*

**MIKE (voice slightly shaking):**  
I thought this building didn’t have six floors.

**TANGO:**  
It didn’t. Not until we needed to find this.

---

*(They pass the side doors. No doorknobs. Just sealed seams in rusted frames. Zeta’s light catches something on one of the walls—an old mark. Scratched deep. A spiral. Repeated over itself until the wall gave way beneath the pressure.)*

**ZETA:**  
Spiral sigil. Venusian origin. Ritual-grade.  
Somebody carved this with intention.

**MIKE:**  
This was never just a motel.

**TANGO (quiet):**  
No. It was a **womb**.

*(The hum increases as they approach the far door. It’s larger than the others. It doesn’t fit the frame. Looks newer—but not cleaner. Like something rebuilt it *from the inside*.)*

**TANGO:**  
It’s breathing.

**ZETA**
Something was pushing from inside. It's been sealed off. Nothing in, or out.

**TANGO**
Stack up.

**MIKE**
Tango—

**TANGO**
We breach it. Now.

*(They position themselves around the door—standard breach posture. The camera shakes slightly from Tango’s pulse. The wall next to the door is moist to the touch.)*

**MIKE**
I've got a bad feeling, boss.

**ZETA**
You’re not alone.

---

*(The humming stops.  
Complete silence.  
For just a second—so complete it feels like pressure.  
Then—)*

**TANGO (cold):**  
On my mark.

## ***BDYRECK-ANNOTATION: START OF BREACH PHASE***
**Location:** Floor 6 – End Door  
**Time Stamp:** 22:48:38  
**Source:** Officer TANGO Bodycam | Audio + Visual Sync  

---

### **FRAME 0001**  
**[Visual]**: Tango stands at the door, side-facing. Mike at rear-left. Zeta rear-right.  
**[Audio]**: Faint exhalation from within room. Door hums faintly. Flashlights stutter in sync.  
**[Note]**: Air temperature spikes +3.4°C in 2.1 seconds.

---

**[TANGO:]**  
One.

---

### **FRAME 0003**  
**[Visual]**: Camera picks up slight bulge in doorframe. Wood looks soft. Sweating.  
**[Audio]**: Structural groan from within. Not mechanical. Almost vocal.  
**[ZETA (low)]:**  
It’s moving.

---

**[TANGO:]**  
Two.

---

### **FRAME 0006**  
**[Visual]**: MIKE shifts. Glove lifts toward visor. Sudden head tilt—possible dizziness.  
**[Audio]**: Heart monitor (Tango) elevates to 113 bpm. Ocean audio re-emerges at 4% gain.

---

**[TANGO:]**   
Three.

---

### **FRAME 0007**  
**[Visual]**: Tango's leg kicks. Door swings inward—no resistance. No creak. No impact. It glides open like paper.  
**[Audio]**: Screeching spike—origin unknown. Not from subject. Not from team.  
**[System]**: BDYREC flags this frame with:  
> ***"MOTION DETECTED… FRONT / LEFT / RIGHT / TOP / BOTTOM / BEHIND…"***

---

### **FRAME 0010**  
**[Visual]**: Light bursts all over.  
**[Camera Sync]**: Visual smearing begins. Color inversion for 0.7s. Room beyond becomes hard to resolve.  
Only central figure remains stable: **the girl**.

---

### **FRAME 0011–0013**  
**[Visual]**: Subject visible.  
- Female. Pale skin. Naked. No immediate physical trauma.  
- Restrained to rusted bedframe. Restraints appear old—fabric and metal.  
- Bed is bolted into floor.  
- Subject’s eyes open. Mouth open.

**[Audio]**: Screaming begins. Full bandwidth. No pattern. No language.  
**[System Note]**: Audio exceeds internal compression. Digital audio bruising begins.

---

### **FRAME 0014**  
**[MIKE]:**  
She’s alive—holy shit—she’s alive!

**[TANGO]:**  
Ma’am, we’re with 7-P. We’re here to help you. Do you hear me?

**[ZETA]:**  
Tango—approach slow. Restraints first.

---

### **FRAME 0017**  
**[Visual]**: TANGO steps closer. Camera jitter increases.  
Flashlight catches damp surface on bed. Looks like sweat or condensation.  
Subject’s screaming doesn’t change tone. Continuous. Almost **mechanical**.  
**[TANGO]:**  
You’re safe. You’re safe. It’s over.

---

### **FRAME 0020–0022**  

**[Audio]**: Low rumble. Not from her.
Subject still screaming. Head turns slightly toward TANGO.

**[ZETA]:**  
Get her loose. We’re pulling out.

**[MIKE]:**  
These cuffs are... they’re not metal. They’re *grown in.* I can’t—  
Jesus, it’s like they’re part of her.

**[TANGO]:**  
She’s freezing. But her skin’s wet. How does that even—

---

### **FRAME 0025**  
**[Audio]**: Screaming **cuts out.**  
Immediate silence.  
Subject locks eyes with Tango. Camaera zoom auto-adjusts—focus sharpens.  
Her lips move. No sound.  

---

### **FRAME 0027**  
**[Visual]**: Straps begin to fray—slowly, like dissolving fiber. No one cuts them.  
Subject lifts arms. Does not struggle. Walks only when pulled. Head tilted.

**[TANGO]:**  
We’re leaving. Zeta?

**[ZETA]:**  
Move. Now.

---

### **FRAME 0029–0032**  
**[Visual]**: Final shot before exit.  
Subject turns her head—just slightly—back toward the room. Her face goes blank.  
**[Audio]**: The ocean returns. Louder now. Pressurized.  
Room temperature drops 6°C in 4 seconds.  

---

### ***BDYRECK-ANNOTATION: END OF BREACH PHASE***

---

## **22:49:11 – EXTRACTION BEGINS

*(Boots on tile. Harsh breathing. The girl is silent now, being carried between Tango and Zeta. Mike leads, weapon drawn. Lights dim.)*

**MIKE**
We’re clear. Let’s move. Fast.

**TANGO**
Got her. Her legs aren’t responding—like she’s… disconnected.

**ZETA**
Focus on the extraction. Don't talk out of place.

*(They reach the stairwell. Mike leads the way, more hardened now. He swings the door open. For a moment, there’s only darkness.)*

**MIKE (hesitating)**
...Wait. We didn’t climb this many floors.

**TANGO (whispers)**
No... we only came up two.

*(They begin descending. Floor by floor. The numbers etched into the concrete are scratched, smeared, distorted—as if the building is trying to forget its own structure.)*

---

### 22:50:18 – FLOOR -1

*(Lights flicker out. Emergency strips glow faint red. The girl makes a sound—not a scream, but a breath like something surfacing from sleep.)**

**MIKE**
This isn’t real.
I—I counted. Two floors up.
We never climbed this far.

**ZETA**
You think too much. Just walk.

**TANGO**
These floors weren’t here on the way in.

### 22:51:03 – FLOOR -3

*(The walls feel closer. The steps narrower. Each floor passed has no doors—just blank landings, like hollow vertebrae.)*

**MIKE**
I can’t tell if we’re descending… or being led.

**TANGO (to the girl)**
Can you hear me? Can you move?

*(She doesn’t respond. But her eyes blink. And she smiles.)*

### 22:52:27 – FLOOR -6

**ZETA**
We're almost there. Stay sharp.

**TANGO (quiet)**
No one asked where “there” was.

*(The girl lifts her head. Looks directly at Mike. Her lips move, soundless. Nothing comes out of her. All of them notice, but each one of them keeps it to himself.)*

### 22:53:15 – FLOOR -8

(In the middle, a hatch. Square, steel and rusted. Federation-issue emergency escape hatch.)

Stamped into its surface:

> “WELCOME BACK TO VENUS, CAPTAIN.”

**MIKE**
This wasn’t here before.

**TANGO**
None of this was.

**ZETA**
Hatch should lead to safety. Open it.

*(MIKE pulls the latch. It gives with a groan. Air rushes through—hot, dry, metallic.)*

*(The outside is grounded with concrete. No reception. No motel.)*

*(They step out. The motel vanishes behind them.)*

*(All that's left is the four of them - Tango, Zeta, Mike, and the girl in her silence.)*

**ZETA (flat)**
Extraction complete.

**TANGO (staring at her)**
No.
Not complete.

She’s still in there.

## **7-P FEDERATION INTERNAL MEMORANDUM**  
**DOCUMENT ID:** IN-FED/POST-RECON-VENUS/0333-9  
**CLASSIFICATION:** RED-LISTED / COMPARTMENTALIZED / EYES-ONLY  
**DATE:** 11-18-1988  
**SUBJECT:** VAP 33-102 – Post-Extraction Review  
**FROM:** OI Analyst Mina J. Holden (Office of Internal Continuity – NEPTUNE)  
**TO:** Clearance-Level III Recipients / Federation Chair Edelweiss

---

### **MISSION SUMMARY:**

On 11-06-1988, Venus Asset Patrol Unit 33-102 (Tango, Zeta, Mike) conducted a classified retrieval sweep at a deprecated structure referred to as the **Vitruvian Motel** (Quadrant 4C). Their mission was to locate and retrieve two lost civilian contractors, presumed deceased or defected. Instead, they encountered and extracted an **unidentified female entity** from an unregistered sixth floor of the structure.

Visual and audio logs recovered from Officer Tango’s BDYRECK have been reviewed in full. Findings are as follows.

---

### **POINTS OF CONCERN:**

1. **FLOOR DISCREPANCY:**  
   Federation blueprints confirm a **maximum of two floors**. Bodycam evidence documents traversal through **at least eight distinct levels** during descent, some of which exhibit **non-Euclidean architecture** and altered time-signatures.

2. **SUBJECT CONDITION:**  
   Female subject appears early twenties, no biometric match on Venusian, Martian, or Earth registries. No visible wounds. No speech during extraction, but extensive **vocalization at the scene** (described as “screaming,” though rhythmically structured).

   Subject has remained **nonverbal, nonresponsive** since return to NEPTUNE quarantine sector. However, neural telemetry indicates **high cortex activity** inconsistent with catatonia.

3. **ENVIRONMENTAL FAILURE:**  
   At the breach site (Floor 6), multiple instruments (audio filtration, motion vector readout, environmental mapping) suffered momentary failure. Acoustic input included **non-human frequency tones** and **waveform anomalies** resembling heartbeat patterns.

4. **LANGUAGE MARKERS:**  
   Tango’s audio log captures whispered speech from the subject. Phonetic analysis inconclusive. One phrase appears to translate loosely into proto-Venusian dialect:

   > “He is beyond the **SUN**.”

   Further linguistic breakdown pending.

5. **POST-EXTRACTION GEOMETRY SHIFT:**  
   Upon emerging from the structure via subterranean tunnel, officers found themselves on an exterior landing with **no visible connection to the registered entrance**. External footage confirms **the motel vanished** from drone scans six minutes after extraction.

---

### **RECOMMENDATIONS:**

- **Subject containment is to be maintained indefinitely.** Transfer to Solar Detention Center is not advised at this time.
- **The Vitruvian Motel site is to be quarantined and expunged** from all Venusian tourism and infrastructure maps.
- Officer Tango is to be placed under observation.  
   Not for dereliction—his record is clean—but for signs of **“semantic drift.”** He has begun using pre-collapse Venusian language during off-hours.
- Full analysis of Floor 6’s **resonance field** is pending.  
   Preliminary readings suggest **spatiotemporal rupture** seeded in that location.

---

### **FINAL NOTE:**

Though the retrieved subject shows no overt aggression, her presence has triggered a **222% spike in long-range Venusian anomaly reports** within the last 24 hours.

This may be correlation.

It may also be the **beginning of the end**.
