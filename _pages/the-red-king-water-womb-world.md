# Period: Present Day … Year: 1989 … Location: VENUS

> An old woman, wrinkled face, hurriedly enters a closed office with a sizeable box of tapes. She tosses most of the lot away and produces one labeled "Vitruvian Motel – VAP 33-102", inserting it into her personal reckoner.
> 
> The reckoner's monitor slowly boots up. She quickly opens the command panel and types the commandline scrawled under the tape.

***BDYRECK-FOOTAGE – VAP 33-102 – 11-06-1988***

***AUDIO… ACTIVE***

MIKE: This thing on? 1-2-3. 1-2-3.

**TANGO:** Uh-huh.  

***VIDEO… ACTIVE***

*The monitor hums and buzzes as it reveals an image of two other men. Guns, rudimentary, almost outdated. Body armor, missing. One's young and scrawny, no helmet on. The other's got a beret and quite the stern look. Stylish balaclava beneath it.*

***MOTION… ACTIVE***

MIKE: Alright. This is **VENUS** Asset Protection... what was it? 

*ZETA:* 33-102.

MIKE: Yeah okay. 33-102. We're here to investigate two critical missing assets. In and out, quick and easy. Our marks were last spotted next to the... "Vitruvian Motel". Two floors. Bit shady that place, in my opinion. Yo Tango, look at this shit! It's fuckin' two stars?  

**TANGO:** Real ace, this one…

*ZETA:* Moving in.

*The squad approaches the front door. The locale looks shady, decrepit, and suspiciously rusty, even for 7-P tourism standards.* 

**TANGO:** Yeah, no. Flashlight on. And keep it on.

*ZETA:* VAP 33-102. Entry point has been breached, moving further in. Natural light waning.

*They enter the reception room - the place is trashed.*

*ZETA:* We're in the reception.

MIKE: I can hear the ocean.

**TANGO:** Don't think about it. They say it's cursed with slave juju shit.

*ZETA:* Shut the fuck up. Both of you.

*Mike proceeds to check the rooms thoroughly alongside his squadmates. Thought nothing was weird on video. 'Till I took a closer look. There were no mirrors in the whole place.*

*ZETA:* Clear.

MIKE: Clear on my side.  

**TANGO:** All clear.

*The three of them continue deeper into the building, ascending the stairs. The sound of the ocean fades out as they ascend to the second floor.*

**TANGO:** The air is stiff.

MIKE: You think someone's been here?

**TANGO:** Look down. There's track marks on the ground. Frenzied steps.

***MOTION DETECTED… FRONT TOWARDS TOP***

*Shadows dance around the room. They don't seem to notice.*

*ZETA:* Clear this place out and check the next floor.

*The lack of mirrors continues to pique my interest. Sound from outside is completely muffled. As I look even closer, there are no windows or balconies. I rewind back. This building had windows. They don't notice, once again. I fastforward to where I left off.*

MIKE: How many fuckin'... floors... does this place have?  

**TANGO:** The report said 6. Chin up, soldier.

*Immediately after opening the entrance to the hallway of Floor 6, the sound of the blood ocean blares against the background. I adjust the volume. I don't know if they hear it.*

**TANGO:** Our mark is here, stay alert.

*They approach the door to Room... I can't fucking tell. I look at it and my head aches.*

MIKE: O-OPEN THE DOOR, IT'S THE FUCKING COPS.  

*ZETA:* Kick it down.

*The door swings open.* 

***MOTION DETECTED… FRONT TOWARDS LEFT TOWARDS RIGHT TOWARDS BOTTOM TOWARDS TOP TOWARDS BEHIND…*** 

***MOTION… ERROR – EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION***

*A fair-skinned woman, no older than 20 at best, lies naked strapped on the bedframe. She seems untouched. She won't stop screaming. She remembers. Despite their efforts, she does not calm down.*

**TANGO:** I'm gonna untie you, ma'am. You are safe. We are here to help you.

*ZETA:* Ma'am, do not run. No sudden movements.

*I hear the serene waves and the clear breeze. I don't want to think about what the room looked like. She was untouched, that's what matters. Mike is not saying a word. They end up dragging her by the handcuffs. She won't stop screaming. They descend 8 times.*

**ZETA:** We're near the end. I see the trapdoor, we're nearly out. You'll be alright.

*They emerge out of the cellar. The rust creaks. They're back at the entrance of the standard issue cement bunker.*

***BDYCAM-FOOTAGE -- VAP 33-102 -- 11-06-1987 - LOGGED OUT OF SESSION***

> *The woman jerks out of her seat and runs toward the nearest exit. There's still time left. Time left to warn them…*
