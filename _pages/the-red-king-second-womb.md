## Period: 15 Years Ago … Year: 1969 … Location: VENUS

_**BDYRECK-FOOTAGE – VAP 06-011 – 03-01-1969**__

_**AUDIO… ACTIVE**__

_The static begins like a whisper. A low hum, pulsing and constant, rises into a droning vibrato—as if the machinery were struggling under the weight of what it must witness. Beneath it, nearly lost in the mechanical murmur, are the faint, ragged sobs of multiple men. Their cries are not sharp, but broken and resigned. Like prayers whispered in a collapsed church.__

YOUNG WOMAN (panting, weeping, laughing): "Fuck—fuck, fuck—I can feel it—I’m so close, I'm so close!"

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (delirious, chanting): "Keep him still. Keep him still. Let the salt pour from his eyes. He deserves no tears. Fuck it dry!"

_**VIDEO… ACTIVE**_

_The visual feed crackles into a blurred vignette. The camera, old and wheezing with each movement, reveals a reception area that has long since surrendered to ruin. Peeling wallpaper curls from the corners like dead skin. What once may have been a place of welcome now reeks of judgment. Every window has been boarded, nailed shut with violence, as though to keep something sacred inside—or to keep salvation out. Thin beams of dusty yellow light leak through the cracks, hazing the room in a surreal half-glow like the hour before an eclipse._

_In the center of the room, gathered in a strange semicircle, six women of differing ages kneel and stand and squat like priestesses at the altar. In their center are three men, bound to chairs fashioned from old office furniture and thick rags. The men are naked, shivering, mouths gagged with what looks like linen once used to dry hands. The women's movements are primal, ritualistic—each engaged in acts of grotesque violation, their eyes glassy with ecstasy or madness or both._

_Every motion is ritual. Every thrust, every scream, every slice is part of some inverted liturgy. They are not desecrating these men. They are offering them. Every drop of blood spilled is communion. Every shriek torn from a throat is a hymn._

_**MOTION… ERROR – EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION**__

YOUNG WOMAN (ecstatic, shaking): "F-fuck… fuck, this is—Christ, that’s the sixth time. It's not enough! It's never fucking enough! I need more!"

_In the background, barely distinguishable from the rotting walls, stands an older woman. She does not move like the others. She is the stillness in the eye of the storm. Her gray hair is bound in bloodied cloth, and her eyes shine with calculated lust._

OLDER WOMAN (low, commanding, divine): "_Abigail.__ He is meat. Tear his manhood from him. With your teeth. Let the last thing he feels be the bite of the Mother."

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (weeping, joyous): "They deserve it, the cocksuckers, the defilers! This is justice, this is scripture!"

_The camera jerks violently, crashing sideways as though knocked by unseen hands. The lens cracks—just slightly—but still functions. It now captures the frame on a crooked angle, revealing something it had not before: scrawled across the hotel’s warped front door is the ancient symbol of VENUS — its edges smeared into spirals, curling like thorns._

OLDER WOMAN (guttural): "Now, open his throat. Slide your blade across it—not fast, but slow. Slow, like you’re tracing scripture. Let the blood spray upon your breasts. Anoint yourself. Let him fill you. You are Her chalice."

OLDER WOMAN (screaming now, eyes rolling back): "Push his cock into his own mouth, make him taste his sin! Fuck the corpse if you must—it is yours. It is sacred."

_The violence continues without pause. For two full hours, the recording captures degradation, mutilation, and a devotion that surpasses cruelty. It is not pornographic. It is not even sadistic. It is ritual. Ceremony. Faith at its most mad and most honest._

_By the end, all three men are lifeless. Their bodies are husks—ripped, drained, desecrated and worshipped. Their eyes are open. Their mouths agape. Their flesh folded in ways it should not fold._

YOUNG WOMAN (giggling): "Oh, Mother, look what I found. This one had a VAP recorder—hey, hey, wasn’t this one your daddy, Sarah?"

_A girl—Sarah—laughs through tears. The two young women collapse into each other’s arms, giggling, their skin slick with blood, spit, and something more ancient._

_Their laughter echoes like bells at the end of a midnight mass._

_From the grand staircase descends a woman with crimson red hair. She's not disrobed and barefoot like the rest. Her hands are marked with ink and cuts._

_She walks with slow grace, eyes half-lidded, as though in constant communion with something unseen. She does not look at the carnage. She simply nods to the elder woman, who receives her as one receives a prophet._

OLDER WOMAN (softly, with awe): "So, it’s done? You’re certain? Absolutely certain it will work?"

REDHEAD (quiet, trembling with sacred glee): "Yes. The threshold is cracked. The altar has been fed. We have seeded her womb with righteous blood. Something beautiful is coming."

REDHEAD (now louder): "Those 7-P bastards will kneel. Their cities will fall. Their tongues will rot in their mouths."

REDHEAD (reserved, dotting): "All it takes is time. Less than a century now. Something stirs below the soil."
