### References:
- Acts:
	- 1 – I've never written anything like this in my life before and I hope I never do so again.
	- 2 – This is actually a heavily modified version of a training drill I wrote in my childhood for an SCP Foundation roleplay community.
	- 3 – Katherina's name is inspired by a name I've considered adopting.
	- 4 – The Mars sequences in general are just… practically paraphrased from my abusers.
	- 5 – The story originally jumped from this right to the sex chapter, skipping the journal entry altogether.
	- 6 – This was actually one of the first things I've written for whole story as a whole! It's interesting how it evolved from here.
	- 7 – "She'd take a step back every now and then, just to keep me off her track" was heavily modified from a poem I wrote about my boyfriend.
	- 8 – "Sex ruins everything that could've been beautiful" is something I'd often tell myself after every doomed relationship I had.
	- 9 – I'm not a chemist. I was neck-deep in Firefox tabs for an hour looking at chemical formulas and elements tables trying to decide what would make just enough sense (whilst still being fictional) for this ultra durable material. The original story called it "Cement", which was ultimately… really confusing.
	- 10 – The very, very first draft of this story had the "break" sequence be a connected thought salad, which made this crucial moment very underwhelming and the reception, as a whole, underwhelming.
	- 11 – Because Katherina says his name in bold, she transfers the power back to him. The syntax of the text being a representation of power was not intended at first, it was just a cool way to highlight planets. But as the story developed, it became part of the plot – notice how Earth is never in bold, precisely because it's not sentient as it died.
	- 12 – That little ad sequence is quite possibly my favorite in the whole story. It was barely changed over time.
	- 13 – I wanted to add AUDIO, VIDEO or MOTION indicators to each and every line, but ultimately it was not worth the effort and made the reading experience more disjointed. Additionally, the power-bold does not apply to Tango uniquely – I simply gave each of them a different name font to make it easier to distinguish them.
	- 14 – The crusade of the new Mars against the source of all evil brings a little hope to this dark world. The Demiurge is in all likelihood the black hole in the center of the galaxy. I was inspired by Romanian fables I grew up with.
	- 15 – The story was not going to end this way originally. It was going to be a repeat of Act 2, with the 7-P Committee grimly discussing the fate of the solar system as they prepared for a new dark age. Ultimately, I think the sacrifice was worth it. Oh and, for some reason for a while I genuinely entertained the idea of making the women violate Edelweiss on live television just for shock value. Let's not.
