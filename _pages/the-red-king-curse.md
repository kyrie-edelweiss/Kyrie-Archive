# Period: Present Day … Year: 1987 … Location: VENUS

_**KATHERINA**, with Mars in her cupped palms, levitates above the yellow atmosphere of Venus. She's fuming with anger, boiling, stewing… frothing. And yet her mouth won't open._

**KATHERINA.** Don't do this. Put me back, please. I thought you loved me.

*Her voice crackles across the night-sky louder than any thunder of Venus.*

**"I THOUGHT I LOVED YOU. BUT YOU WERE JUST ALL I HAD. YOU MADE SURE YOU WERE ALL I HAD."**

That's not true, **KATHERINA**. You were all I had too – celestial bodies were never allowed to interact with humans. I broke all the rules just to get to know you. I wanted to see what it was like.

**"SEE WHAT? TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO USE SOMEONE LIKE A FLESH SOCK?"**

It wasn't my intention, dear… you showed me what pleasure felt like. I grew addicted, I grew more and more discontent with the lack of feeling I was cursed with – I wanted more and more. I'm so sorry, I'm sorry **KATHERINA**.

_**KATHERINA** can't think of anything._

**KATHERINA**, dear. We can fix this. You just have to trust me. Remember when we first met? Let's start again… This time, you say my name first.

**"NO. I REFUSE. I CAN'T LET YOU TAKE CONTROL AGAIN."**

Don't be stubborn, love. You've grown so much… there's no point in all this control non-sense anymore. And… I've always watched you from afar. I know you – I always kept an eye out for you, because you were special. Hey, hey, now…

_**KATHERINA** goes speechless. Her facial expression is one of contempt, confusion, and regret._

Aren't you my little **SUN**?

*She screams. And the scream echoes. And the scream fades. And underneath that layer of noise, she's sobbing. Sobbing like a little crybaby. Sobbing like she just lost her parents. Her palms relax.*

Hey, hey, calm. Don't you want to know your parents? Your childhood?

_**KATHERINA** wants to know. She really, really does want to know. It's her chance, her only one.*_

**"I… I DO. I DO WANT TO KNOW"**

You were born of two Venusian mothers. They loved and cherished you – they would've done everything to keep you. This is not the way things go in this world, unfortunately. Men in armor from some far-away planet came and took little **KATHERINA** away. I watched you grow up in the bunkers of these men – they'd malnourish you, hurt you and call you awful names – they thought you were an ill omen, an icon of the coming Apocalypse. When you were of age, they injected you with some white substance, and you forgot everything. They dropped you off somewhere far away, as they packed their bags up and shot everyone left in the head. This is your story, **KATHERINA**. This is what you wanted to hear, right?

*Her stomach knots. **KATHERINA** grips Mars harder.*

**"THAT CAN'T BE… IT'S LIES… YOU'RE LYING AGAIN…"**

Stop… Stop! You're hurting me!

*She reflexively relaxes her fingers, and releases her clenched palms.*

This is what I wanted to protect you from. The bitter truth, and the pain that comes with it. I love you, **KATHERINA**, I really do. Can we start again? Do you trust me?

*She's decided.*

**"I TRUST YOU."**

Say my name.

**"MARS… I-"**

*Katherina falls - she falls further than she's ever fallen before. Not in love… but in altitude. She's dropping to the ground.*

_**MARS** catches her._

**"I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.**

*Katherina turns pale. Her eyes, empty. Her Venusian soul-essence is returning to the cursed ground she was made of.*

**"MY LITTLE SUN. I NEVER MEANT FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. I JUST CAN'T… I CAN'T BELIEVE I ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN…"**

_**MARS** strokes her shriveling, now-white hair._

**"VENUS IS DEAD."**

**"I NAME YOU VENUS."**

**"LONG LIVE VENUS."**

*And **VENUS** would be once more.*
