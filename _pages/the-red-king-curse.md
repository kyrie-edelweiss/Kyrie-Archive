## Period: Present Day … Year: 1987 … Location: Venus

_(Above the churning yellow clouds of Venus, **KATHERINA** levitates. In her cupped palms, she holds MARS—small, dim, stripped of dominion. Her jaw is clenched. Her eyes burn. She's fuming with anger, boiling, stewing… frothing. And yet her mouth won't open.)_

*Mars*: (begging)
Don't do this.  
Put me back, please.  
I thought you loved me.

_**KATHERINA**_: (voice booming across the night sky):  
**I THOUGHT I LOVED YOU. BUT YOU WERE JUST ALL I HAD. YOU MADE SURE YOU WERE ALL I HAD.**

*Mars*: (softly)
That’s not true, **KATHERINA**.  
You were all *I* had too.  
Celestial bodies were never meant to touch the human world.  
But I broke the rules. For you.  
I just wanted to feel.  
To know what it was like.

_**KATHERINA**_: (seething):  
**SEE WHAT? TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO USE SOMEONE LIKE A FLESH SOCK?**

*Mars*:  
It wasn’t supposed to go like that.  
You taught me what pleasure meant.  
I didn’t know what it was to *want* before you.  
And then… I couldn’t stop.  
I was cursed with hunger.  
And you—  
You were so warm.  
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, **KATHERINA**.

_(Silence. She doesn’t answer. He shifts in her palms.)_

*Mars*:  
We can fix this.  
We’ve both changed.  
Let’s start again.  
This time… you say my name first.

_**KATHERINA**_:  
**"NO. I REFUSE. I CAN'T LET YOU TAKE CONTROL AGAIN."**

*Mars*: (gently):  
Oh, my love. Control?  
You’ve grown so much.  
There's no point in controlling you anymore.  
And I’ve always watched you from afar.  
Even when you thought you were alone.  
I know you - I always kept an eye out for you.
Because you were special…  

_(Her face flickers—contempt, grief, longing. She begins to tremble.)_

*Mars*: (whispering):  
Aren’t you…  
my little **SUN**?

_(Her scream splits the upper atmosphere. Then, beneath the scream—sobs. Raw. Childlike. Her hands loosen.)_

*Mars*: (soothing):  
Shh… calm, calm now.  
You want to know, don’t you?  
The truth. About your parents. Your origin.  
Who you really are?

_(She hesitates. Then a quiet answer.)_

_**KATHERINA**_:  
**"I… I DO. I DO WANT TO KNOW."**

*Mars*:  
You were born of two Venusian mothers.  
They loved you more than anything in this world.  
They would’ve kept you, protected you, worshipped you.  

But men came.  
Men in armor from a distant planet.  
They ripped you from their arms.  
Raised you underground in bunkers.  
Malnourished you. Hurt you.  
Called you names—  
_Bad omen. Chimera. Icon of the coming Apocalypse._

When you came of age, they injected you.  
White, liquid forgetfulness.  
You forgot everything.  
And when they were done with you—  
They threw you out.  
They shot everyone else.  
Left you to wander.

That’s your story, **KATHERINA**.  
Isn’t that what you wanted?

_(She convulses. Rage and disbelief churn in her gut. She grips MARS tighter.)_

_**KATHERINA**_:  
**"THAT CAN'T BE… IT'S LIES… YOU'RE LYING AGAIN…"**

*Mars*: (gasping):  
Stop—please—you’re hurting me!

_(Reflex. Her grip loosens.)_

*Mars*: (whimpering):  
I was trying to protect you…  
From the bitter truth and all the pain that comes with it.  
I love you, **KATHERINA**.  
We can begin again.  
Do you trust me?

_(A pause. Her mind sways like a candle in vacuum.)_

_**KATHERINA:**_ (quiet):  
**"I TRUST YOU."**

*Mars*:  
Say my name.

_**KATHERINA**_:_  
**"MARS… I—"**

_(The moment the name passes her lips, the spell snaps.)_

_Katherina:_  
—NO—

_(But it’s too late. She drops. Her body plummets, limp, through the sulfurous skies. Falling—not in love, but back to earth. Into ruin.)_

_**MARS**_: (ascending, regaining form):  
**I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.**

_(He catches her gently. Her skin pales. Her hair drains of color. Her eyes go hollow. Her essence returns to Venus—the place of her making, and of her unmaking.)_

_**MARS**_: (stroking her hair):  
**MY LITTLE SUN.** 
**I NEVER MEANT FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.** 
**I JUST…**
**I CAN'T BELIEVE I ALLLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN.**

_(He lowers her down—into the dirt.)_

_**MARS**_: (whispering):  
**"VENUS IS DEAD."**  
**"I NAME YOU VENUS."**  
**"LONG LIVE VENUS."**

_(And **VENUS** would be once more.)_
