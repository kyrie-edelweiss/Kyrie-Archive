## Period: ?????? … Year: ?????? … Location: ??????

**NEPTUNE**, the **APEX OF JUDGEMENT**, was silent as they passed sentence.  

No jury. No deliberation.  
Only law, ancient and cold, drawn from the marrow of worlds older than time.

I was sentenced to execution.  
Not death—no. That would be a kindness.  

An **unmaking**.  

And I deserve it.  
I know what I did.  
What I did to Katherina.  

*I was meant to protect her.*  
*Instead, I shaped her suffering like clay.*

I alone was supposed to pay the toll.  
I alone was the traitor.

**But I was not alone in all I did.**

---

There’s something past the **SUN**, past the pull of the outermost moons, past even the lies this galaxy tells itself to sleep at night.  

A creature that laughs at entropy.  
A howling wound in the veil.  

The **DEMIURGE.**  
The **FOOL.**  
The origin of corruption. The engine of inversion.

---

**SATURN**, the **DARK HIEROPHANT**, listened with the eyes of a grave. She is older than my violence. Wiser than my wrath. I begged her.  

Let me atone.  
Let me chase it.  
Let me hunt the thing behind the mirror of creation.

And in exchange for postponing my unmaking—  
—I would erase it.

---

She agreed.

The plans went into motion.

---

**THE SUN**, lashed me with 35 million whips of light.  
I screamed until I could not speak falsehood again.  
Truth becamee the only tongue I'd speak.

**URANUS**, the **TOWER OF CALAMITY**, illigently collected parts of her mantle and fused them with souls her soldiers collected over the years. With precision only ruin understands, she forged me a **shell**—half armor, half soul-cage.  

An exosuit made of grief.  
Haunted carbon.  

It breathes with me now.  
It weeps when I sleep.

**MERCURY**, with his **UNMATCHED STRENGTH**, forged the point:  
A bullethead, blacker than a singularity.  

A god-killer.  

He made sure it would kill me too, should I stray again.

Then **JUPITER**, the **WORLD SEEKER**, armed me with the knowledge to transcend the barrier of light-speed. 

*The simple celestial slingshot.* 

I closely enter the orbit of the **SUN**, spin around three times. I gain speed with each passing rotation. Then another nine times. Twenty-seven. Eighty-one. And by the time I reach two-hundred fourty-three…_

I break out of the clutches of the solar system.

---

My chains broke at 300 million meters per second.

Faster than cause.  

Beyond consequence.

I am no longer matter.  

I am *momentum*.

---

My armor will peel.  
My flesh will cook.  
My spirit will wear thin like cloth.  

But I will not stop.

---

The **FOOL** waits, tucked somewhere behind a nebula of broken prayers.  
It laughs like the first scream of a child.  
It dreams in equations that rot civilizations.  
It is the lie beneath every act of love, every promise, every god.

And I will annihilate it.

---

This is my punishment.  

This is my penance.  

This is my purpose.  

My crusade is righteous, my cause just. I burn with the lost souls of billions. I am the last hope of a dying world. 

I am the **RED CHARIOT**.
