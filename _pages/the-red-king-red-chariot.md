_**NEPTUNE**, the **APEX OF JUDGEMENT** would seal my fate – execution._

*I'm guilty for what I've done to Katherina.*

*I alone was supposed to pay the toll.*

*However.*

*I was not alone in all I did.*

*There is something out there. Something way past the **SUN**, way past the reaches of this **GALAXY**.*

_The **DEMIURGE**, the **FOOL**._

_**SATURN**, the **DARK HIEROPHANT**, was wise beyond my years. She'd understand. I pleaded to her during the trial. In exchange for postponing my inevitable execution, I'd give them all the death of this **DEMIURGE**. I'd make it pay, I'd find the root of the cosmic evil and I'd erase it forever…_

*The plans went into motion.*

*The **SUN** would discipline me with his 35,000,000 whips for an untold time so I would never lie again.*

_**URANUS**, the **TOWER OF CALAMITY**, dilligently collected parts of her mantle and fused them with souls her soldiers collected over the years, coalescing them into my otherwordly carbon shell – it would offer both physical and spiritual protection. Then, **MERCURY**, with his **UNMATCHED STRENGTH**, would spend years dividing his magmatic core to forge a bullethead capable of splitting stars in two – equipped with a kill-switch in the likelihood I defect. Encased in my custom shell of death, I never felt more ready._

_Finally, **JUPITER**, the **WORLD SEEKER**, armed me with the knowledge to transcend the barrier of light-speed – the simple celestial slingshot. I closely enter the orbit of the **SUN**, spin around three times. I gain speed with each passing rotation. Then another nine times. Twenty-seven. Eighty-one. And by the time I reach two-hundred fourty-three…_

*I break out of my gravitational prison.*

*I barrel through the inky expanse of space at 300,000,000 meters a second.*

*As my hatred simmers and burns in me, I become faster, lighter. My armor will eventually break, but my resolve not.*

_The **FOOL** will pay for everything – every wrongdoing ever done, be it celestial or terrestrial. No matter how many milennia it'll take._

_My crusade is righteous, my cause just. I burn with the lost souls of billions. I am the last hope of a dying world. The **RED CHARIOT**._
