## Content Warning – *The Red King*  
*The Red King © 2025 by Kyrie D'Agostino contains intense, graphic, and symbolically complex depictions of trauma, abuse, and power. The story uses nonlinear timelines, metaphysical horror, and recursive storytelling to explore themes of oppression, autonomy, and revolution. Please proceed with caution.*

---

### General Themes  
- **Sexual Violence & Coercion** (Metaphorical & Literal):  
  Graphic depictions of ritualized, non-consensual metaphysical intimacy—especially in **"Submission"**, **"Inversion"**, and **"Renaissance"**. Includes repeated coercion through voice, recursion, and performance.

- **Trauma and Dissociation:**  
  Characters dissociate to survive control. Past versions of themselves appear as voices, flashbacks, and parallel identities. Emotional numbing, detachment from body, and recursive memory loss are used narratively and symbolically.

- **Psychological Horror:**  
  The narrative itself is used as a weapon. Characters are rewritten, looped, and observed by omniscient forces. Recurring themes include surveillance, recursion, control through affection, and collapse of self under divine attention.

- **Religious & Institutional Abuse:**  
  The Seven Planet Authority (SPA), the Saturnian Faiths, and revolutionary Venus all use religious or ideological doctrine to justify violation, correction, and ritualized control of women and trans people.

- **Body Autonomy Violation:**  
  The protagonist’s body is repeatedly stripped of agency—not only by external forces but by the structure of the story itself. Voice, breath, and orgasm are stolen or performed through her. This violation is portrayed through stylized, symbolic intimacy.

- **Symbolic Sexualization of Power:**  
  Abuse is frequently sexualized to critique systems that eroticize domination.

- **Mythic Repetition & Narrative Abuse:**  
  The story explores cycles of trauma not just as memory, but as literal world-building architecture.

### Specific Chapter Warnings  

**The Prologue - Not A Womb** contain ritualized sexual violence presented in mythic tone.

**Chapter Twelve – Submission** features the protagonist breaking briefly free from the loop, only to fall back into it—depicting loss of autonomy through voice and performance.

**Chapter Thirteen – Inversion** and **Chapter Fourteen – Renaissance** contain deeply unsettling scenes of recursive consent erasure, cosmic obsession, and narrative-constructed rape attempts.

**Chapter Sixteen – Flies Have Their House** includes the direct execution of a political figure on-screen.

### Additional Themes  

- **Trans Trauma & Body Politics:**  
  Some characters face body-based misgendering, institutional passing pressure, and dysphoria under state surveillance. These themes are portrayed with care, anger, and eventual reclamation.

- **Suicidal Ideation / Depersonalization:**  
  Several characters express or embody a longing for nonexistence, narrative erasure, or surrender to void—often as a consequence of unending abuse cycles.

- **Paranoia, Looping, Surveillance:**  
  The narrative is nonlinear and recursive by design. Loops, glitches, memory rewrites, and metafictional interference create a destabilizing atmosphere. Abuse is replayed through architecture, dialogue, and literal page structure.

- **Cosmic Eroticism & Mythic Horror:**  
  Gods, planets, and entities attempt to possess women through symbolic or literal narrative seduction. The eroticization of annihilation and intimacy with cosmic forces is frequent.

### Reader Discretion is Strongly Advised.  
This narrative is built to disturb, deconstruct, and challenge. It directly critiques systemic violence, patriarchal myth, and narrative complicity in abuse. The story is not intended for casual readers and may trigger intense emotional or psychological responses. The author drew inspiration from her past experiences.
