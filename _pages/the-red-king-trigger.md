## Content Warning – *The Red King*  
*The Red King © 2025 by Kyrie D'Agostino contains intense, graphic, and symbolically complex depictions of trauma, abuse, and power. The story uses nonlinear timelines, metaphysical horror, and recursive storytelling to explore themes of oppression, autonomy, and revolution. Please proceed with caution.*

---

### General Themes  
- **Sexual Violence & Coercion** (Metaphorical & Literal):  
  Graphic scenes of non-consensual metaphysical intimacy (especially in "Red Sex"), often presented as planetary-scale violation. Includes psychological manipulation, repetition of traumatic acts, dissociation during abuse, and eroticized control.

- **Trauma and Dissociation:**  
  Depictions of dissociation, memory suppression, flashbacks, and coping mechanisms to survive ongoing violation.

- **Psychological Horror:**  
  Characters are subjected to control by godlike forces. Constant themes of surveillance, helplessness, existential dread, and the distortion of memory, identity, and time.

- **Religious & Institutional Abuse:**
  Authoritarian systems (SPA, Saturn cults, Venusian revolution) use religion, state violence, and indoctrination to control women and trans individuals.

- **Body Autonomy Violation:**  
  The main protagonist’s body is repeatedly controlled by a cosmic entity and later a metaphysical entity, with her autonomy stripped through voice, memory, and ritual. Physical responses are manipulated and fetishized against her will.

- **Trauma & Dissociation:**	
  Recurring depictions of survivors detaching from their bodies or reality to endure abuse. Dissociative states are used narratively and symbolically.

- **Symbolic Sexualization of Power:**  
  Many scenes depict abusive power in a stylized, sexual manner to critique ritualistic submission structures (e.g., _Red Sex_, _Inversion_, _Rebirth_).

### Specific Chapter Warnings

**The Prologue** (Not A Womb) & **Chapter Six** (Red Sex) contain grotesquely graphic sexual violence.

---

### Additional Themes
- **Trans Trauma & Body Politics**:  
  Several characters (like Alva) face institutional dehumanization, especially under SPA doctrine. Themes of misgendering, erasure, and resistance are central.

- **Suicidal Ideation / Depersonalization**:  
  Multiple characters hint at or express wishes for erasure, death, or unmaking as an escape from narrative control.

- **Paranoia, Looping, Surveillance**:  
  Reality is non-linear. The story itself becomes a participant in the abuse. Time loops, recursion, memory-wiping, and altered states are used to simulate the disorientation of long-term abuse

---

### Reader Discretion is Strongly Advised.

This narrative is built to challenge, disturb, and ultimately critique cycles of systemic abuse, power worship, and gendered control. The author drew inspiration from her own experiences. It is **not intended for casual or sensitive audiences** without preparation.
