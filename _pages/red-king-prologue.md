_**AUDIO… ACTIVE**_

The static hums, low and steady, vibrating with tension, like an old machine working itself into oblivion. Beneath the noise, there is something darker—a muffled rhythm of breathing, ragged and desperate. The cries of men, distorted and broken, fill the silence between mechanical growls. Their voices are not sharp—more like the gasps of drowning creatures, their calls twisted into something far less human.

**YOUNG WOMAN** (panting, weeping, laughing):  
_"Fuck—fuck, fuck—I can feel it—I'm so close, I'm so close!"_

**MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN** (fevered, chanting):  
_"Hold him still, Hold him still! Keep his head like that!"_

_**VIDEO… ACTIVE**_

The grainy feed flickers, revealing a room ravaged by time. The walls are cracked, peeling like old skin, the air thick with the smell of decay. The floor is littered with scraps, remnants of something long dead. The light is weak, seeping in through narrow slats, casting a sickly glow that stretches the shadows into grotesque shapes.  

At the center of the room, six women form a circle. Some kneel, some stand, others squat, their postures aggressive, unnatural—like animals closing in on their prey. In the middle, three men are bound to battered chairs, their bodies naked and trembling. The women move around them with ruthless precision, their eyes wild, glazed over with fervor. Every motion is deliberate, but there is no grace—only hunger, a desperation that pushes beyond the bounds of reason.

The men are gagged, bound with thick, soiled linen. They are nothing more than vessels—emptied of their humanity, reduced to objects for the women’s ritual. The air hums with the rhythm of it all: thrusts, screams, cuts, and grunts that blur into one chaotic symphony of violent devotion.

Each stroke, each tear of flesh, each cry from the men is not an act of cruelty—no, it is an offering. Every drop of blood is sacrament. Every scream is a hymn of liberation, a hymn that sings the destruction of everything they have known. The women’s movements are erratic, almost animalistic in their zeal.

_**MOTION… ERROR – EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION**_

**YOUNG WOMAN** (her voice shaken, ecstatic, as though on the brink of madness):  
_"No—no, fuck, this isn’t enough! I need more—it's never enough! More!"_

In the background, an older woman stands alone. Her presence is calm, composed, like the eye of a storm. Her hair is streaked with gray and bound tightly, but her gaze is sharp—calculating. She watches, her eyes filled with the kind of certainty that comes only from true belief.

**OLDER WOMAN** (low, commanding):  
_"Abigail. He is nothing but meat. Tear his cock off. With your teeth."_

**MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN** (weeping, celebratory):  
_"They deserve it—they deserve this! This is what they’ve done to us. This is the only justice we have!"_

The camera lurches suddenly, as though struck by an invisible force. The frame tilts, showing the warped doorframe of the room—scrawled across it, the sigil of Venus, twisted and deformed.

**OLDER WOMAN** (gravelly, reverent):  
_"Cut him. Slice his throat slowly—don’t rush. Like you’re tracing the lines of a book. Let the blood spray on your breasts."_

The brutality escalates, and the women are no longer women—they are instruments of vengeance, instruments of destruction. Their ecstasy is not sexual—it is a release of everything they've held back for so long. For hours, the recording captures them in a feverish ritual of domination, mutilation, and a perverse devotion to their cause.

By the end of it, the men are unrecognizable—husk-like, their bodies desecrated, drained, and laid bare. Their eyes are still open, their mouths hanging wide, as if they were left in a state of perpetual shock.

**YOUNG WOMAN** (giggling, joyous):  
_"Look at this—this one had a reckorder. Hey, wasn't this one your daddy, Sarah?"_

A girl named Sarah laughs, tears streaming down her face. The two young women collapse into each other’s arms, their bodies slick with blood, their laughter filled with madness—a final, almost sacred release.

_Their laughter rings through the desolate room like the tolling of a bell._

A figure steps down the staircase from above—a woman with crimson hair. She moves slowly, deliberately, as though the entire world is beneath her. Unlike the others, she is not disrobed and barefoot. Her presence is one of quiet authority, a force of nature moving in calm defiance of the chaos around her.

She steps forward, unflinching in the face of the destruction, and nods to the elder woman, who watches her with something akin to awe.

**OLDER WOMAN** (softly, reverently):  
_"It’s done? You're sure? Absolutely sure it will work?"_

**REDHEAD** (decided):  
_"Yes. The threshold is cracked. Something is coming—something beautiful."_

**REDHEAD** (louder, with growing fervor):  
_"Those SPA bastards—they will kneel. Their cities will fall. Their tongues will rot in their mouths."_

**REDHEAD** (quiet, resolute):  
_"Something stirs beneath the surface."_

# Chapter Two – A Brief Meeting
**TIMESTAMP:** Early-To-Mid 1976  
**ERA:** POST-COLLAPSE  
**LOCATION:** NEPTUNE – Executive Council Chamber, Tower A-Prime  
**CLASSIFICATION:** BLACK CODE – UNAUTHORIZED MATERIAL

---

> *"Empires don’t collapse. They consent to their own decay—one executive meeting at a time."*  
> — Anonymous

---

A cohort of twelve high-ranking personnel are positioned equidistantly around a long, mirror-polished black conference table within a spacious, meticulously curated executive chamber. At the helm, a commanding figure presides—posture poised, hands interlaced with practiced composure.  

The figure wears the standardized gray of the executive tier—anonymizing, sexless—her silver nameplate glinting in the overhead fluorescents like a cautionary blade. She does not smile often, but when she does, it is calculated.  

She sits with practiced ease, palms lightly resting on the table’s edge. Her voice is tuned to professional warmth—a shade softer than Hertz’s metallic cadence, but never so soft it could be misread as uncertain.

---

**EDELWEISS** (pleasant, firm):  

“Good morning, gentlemen. My name is **Avery-Mary Edelweiss**, executive director of this board. This is **William Hertz**, my senior strategic officer. I will be conducting roll call while my assistant matches names to faces. Please respond when your name is called."

_Her words are crisp, her cadence refined by decades of institutional leadership. Her voice carries the affect of someone who has long since learned how to suppress both her accent and her allegiance to anything **but** the company._

“That's everyone? Excellent. I hereby declare—the first official **Seven Planet Committee** board meeting is underway.”

*A click is heard as the airlocks seal. She continues, without pause.*

“First, allow me to extend formal commendation.  Your selection was not incidental—your track records have been reviewed, audited, and validated at the highest levels. Let this moment serve as a rare acknowledgment: your contributions are seen. They are appreciated. Well done.”

*A ripple of polite laughter. Applause follows—brief. She does not join in.* 

“The Committee is a direct response to radical sex supremacism.”

*Pause. Silence washes over the room.* 

“The **Seven Planet Authority** has extended generous funding to formalize our department—under one condition, that the Venusian movement falls before 1990. Our mission is paramount—their forces must be nullified & Venus rightfully reclaimed.”  

*The room breaks into structured applause.*  

*She does not smile. She simply nods once—subtle, contained—then signals to her second-in-command.*

“I’ll now hand it over to William, who will provide an overview of the case-by-case situation. He’s a very smart, capable, and passionate man.” 



---



_William Hertz steps forward with measured authority. A low mechanical hum follows as the **reckoner**, embedded into the ceiling panel, activates. The chamber lights dim slightly. A translucent projection materializes on the wall behind him—clean, minimal, and institutional blue._





### SECTOR 1: MERCURY  

Visual: A scorched, wind-blasted colony; heat-map overlay in red; massive half-sunken refineries and molten conveyor belts; shattered atmospheric domes; “Threat Vector: Eliminated.”  

**HERTZ**:  

“Mercury was once the SPA's industrial keystone—the prime node for arms production, heavy manufacturing, and exo-alloy synthesis.  Following a sabotage event targeting atmospheric filtration systems, the colony is currently non-viable. No recovery operations are scheduled. While regrettable, the loss neutralizes a significant threat vector. Reconstruction efforts will prioritize enhanced security infrastructure.

*He pauses. The screen flickers.*

**HERTZ**:  

“A moment of silence, please, for all confirmed *client* casualties.”  

*The projection dims to a dark gray, displaying a silent counter of names: 1481 dead.*



### SECTOR 2: VENUS  

 **Visual:** Glitched-out industrial landscape—static interference; silhouettes of women holding rifles rendered in black; “1966: Total Comms Loss | 1969: Final Withdrawal”  

**HERTZ**:  

“Economically designed around a bustling tourism sector fielded by a predominantly female workforce. By 1952, Venus had shifted into the central market of female exports, services and labor. Historical landmarks were destroyed to make room for refineries, markets, and correction facilities. Other sectors would follow with their own variations of the New Venusian Model—on a smaller scale.  

*Pause. Red light is cast over the conference chamber.*

HERTZ: (gesturing)

“The present day situation is critical. The rebellion began around 1955 with linguistic deviation—somehow, the girls learned words we never taught them. Appeasement started in 1957, under Clause 19-C "Right To Name". By 1962, the Venusian revolution entered full swing—they'd organized cells, procured arms from god-knows-where, and converted several facilities into their forward bases. Communications ceased entirely in 1966. All management infrastructure has been destroyed by 1967. Local security assets were extracted in 1969 following the Two Year Stand. From a strategic standpoint, every inhabitant of Venus is now considered a threat and should be dealt with accordingly.”  

*The crimson dims out as the projector subtly distorts, as if infected by the chaos Venus represents.*



### SECTOR 3: EARTH  

**Visual:** Grayscale Earth turning slowly; “DECOMMISSIONED” stamped across its surface, timeline overlay of mass migration off-planet  



**HERTZ**:  (unmoved)

“There is little to address about Earth.*  

“It's no longer a recognized operating territory..*



*Green shifts, then stills. Edelweiss follows. Her thumb grazes the inside of her palm twice. A tell no one has ever commented on.*



### SECTOR 4: MARS  

**Visual:** Red dunes swallowing machines, strange static glyphs appearing momentarily; status reads: “UNEXPLAINED FAILURE”  



**HERTZ**:  

 “Despite its status as our first colonization candidate, every initiative has ended in unexplained failure. It remains unoccupied, and likely will remain so.  

*The reckoner emphasizes a flashing red buffer zone around the planet’s orbit.*

“Fortunately, its remoteness and symbolic importance to the insurgents acts as a natural barrier to ideological contagion.”



### SECTOR 5: JUPITER  

**Visual:** R&D moons in orbit; data streams showing green operational metrics; Callisto marked “UNDER SURVEILLANCE”  

**HERTZ**:  

“Our R&D satellites—Io, Europa, and Ganymede—remain stable and ideologically neutral. We intend to increase funding to maintain their strategic output.”  

*He nods toward the red-pulsing marker on Callisto.*  

**HERTZ**:  

“Minor disturbances have been reported, but remain manageable.”

*Weiss quietly promises he'll take care of it.*



### SECTOR 6: SATURN  

Visual: Glowing ring cities with stained-glass hues; fine-print contracts scroll in the corner; stat: “204,239 Faith Centers”

**HERTZ**:  

“Since our departure from Earth, **SATURN** has served as a nexus for spiritual and cultural continuity. The settlements are autonomous and doctrinally rigid. Our presence is limited, bound by longstanding contract. Intervention is neither advised nor welcomed.”

_Lamont, **SATURN**’s representative, gives a brief nod of approval._



### SECTOR 7: URANUS  

**Visual:** A single black Pillar piercing planet core-to-cloud; endless rows of male trainees marching in silence; silhouettes amid masses of men labeled “TARGET – EXECUTE”



**HERTZ**:  

“Our central defense contractor training site. The Pillar spans from planetary core to upper atmosphere and lower atmosphere. This is an exclusively-male sector.”  

*The reckoner highlights internal maps of training regimens and punishment queues.*  

“Execution protocols are in place for any suspected sympathizer of Venusian ideology. With proper oversight, further action will be minimal.”  

*Kildare, ex-military, remains stone-faced.*



### SECTOR 8: NEPTUNE  

**Status:** CRITICAL // CURRENT LOCATION  

**Visual:** A world-spanning metropolis; stacked architecture like corporate files, sprawling underground nerve-map; a blinking green dot marks their current position

**HERTZ**:  

“Our administrative capital. Beneath the surface lies a vast bureaucratic nerve center—synchronization at full capacity. Every directive, every protocol, begins here.”  

*The reckoner zooms in on interlinking tunnel paths and encrypted communication feeds, painting a network of control.*

“This is our current position. If **NEPTUNE** falls,” he pauses, letting the final slide pulse, “we all fall.”



_A standing ovation erupts, echoing through the grand chamber. The reckoner slowly fades to black, leaving only the emblem of the **Seven Planet Committee** hovering midair like a watchful eye._

*She sat alone after the meeting. Ten minutes. No movement.*
